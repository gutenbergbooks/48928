<p class="par first">Trembling in a fervor of joy the girl confronted
it. Everybody in the excitement of arrival was trying to crowd her away
from the packed railing of the vessel, but she managed to get her
glimpse of that magic reality&mdash;one of those golden far Eastern
cities that she had dreamed of all her life on the other side of the
world. Its glittering towers and domes, bursting out of the garden of
the equator, pointed to a sky clear enough to be heaven itself. Here
long ago East and West had first gloriously mingled; once this city of
golden galleons had commanded all the cities of the Pacific. To so many
a conquistador it had been the end of the rainbow! To the girl gazing
out on its fiercely sunlit walls it held the secret of the future.</p>
<p class="par">In the launches skurrying up alongside the vessel, Julie
saw the eager, expectant faces straining for a glimpse of friends or
kin. As she looked down, this new universe seemed suddenly to sit on
her head like a red-hot ball. She felt a moment&rsquo;s stifling sense
of its weight. This was the world to which she had come, seeking a
place. Those towers and domes, piercing glittering space like swords
and scimitars, appeared suddenly to intimate that some special passport
was needed to enter this world. And she had not lived long enough in
the universe to feel at home anywhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>she might be. Her detached
existence under her uncle&rsquo;s roof, always out of touching distance
with the family, had engendered that feeling of isolation. She had been
a superfluous personality, outside the magic circle, and had kept to
the farthest retreat of that unfriendly house of life&mdash;a vivid
little hermit groping around the walls of her own chamber for the
fourth dimension. Hopelessly rigid that old universe had been&mdash;and
immutable&mdash;till one day it had astonishingly crumbled, as if by
some special decree.</p>
<p class="par">Julie was here on this vessel, looking out in
trepidation on a remote and inconjecturable land, because her
uncle&rsquo;s affairs, always quite prosperous, had broken on the rocks
of investments. Out of the wreck she had emerged into a dizzy
independence. It had devolved upon her to take charge of herself
somehow&mdash;the verdict of her life! The walls had burst forever. To
own one&rsquo;s self! To claim unhindered a whole patch of the
universe! Beyond there, in that city of pearl-circled walls, a
trans-section of existence was hers.</p>
<p class="par">Crowds were now streaming all over the decks. The
greetings of long separations everywhere. Julie saw joyous laughter and
frank tears. Some of the men had come in from the wilderness where
peril and disease were daily fortune, and their white faces and
emaciated forms startled their womenfolk; others were strong and brown,
and conquest and construction hung upon their brows like a kind of
fever. Julie looked carefully at them all as at an index page of what
lay before her. After having begun to feel that she had come to the end
of the earth, she took courage. It was brought forcibly to her that
America had come into the East to do something actual&mdash;that she
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>raised her standards of democracy among ancient
kingdoms, and would stir them to their foundations.</p>
<p class="par">As far back as she could remember Julie had felt the
lure of Great Adventures. In ardent lyric imaginings she had, from
childhood up, seen herself following always the rapture of unbeaten
tracks. The Golden Gate, with its shimmering allure opening upon the
promise of strange lands, had always been the biggest emotion in her
life. The wind that blew up from it had been a messenger summoning her
across that sparkling water to the freedom that lay beyond those ports
of dreams.</p>
<p class="par">Staring at the simplicity and the strength of these
people of the New World, she wondered if her slim credentials would
hold among them. She was not really what they wanted here&mdash;a
trained artisan. Somehow she had managed to slip by in the stress of
the moment. It was her own desperate determination to balk all efforts
to keep her under dominance at home that had brought her to this goal.
It had developed that she was fitted for nothing in an organized
society. Her music, her languages, her sense of existence were all too
fragmentary to negotiate.</p>
<p class="par">But it had transpired that there was another world where
matters of existence were not so stringent&mdash;and since few had
seemed inclined to hazard them, Jepton&rsquo;s Teachers&rsquo; Agency
had let her pass on the certificate of Miss Blossom&rsquo;s School,
which had been good for nothing else. In a breathless transport, she
had signed herself to service in our colonial possessions across the
seas. There was a salary, of course&mdash;ten per cent. of which for
the first year went to Jepton&rsquo;s; a rather inadequate stipend, it
had been prophesied, for colonial existence. But to the reality
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>of this Julie had given no thought. She was a woman
at last&mdash;with an original face and a surprising faculty for seeing
splendor in everything. Just the kind of person whose na&iuml;ve
encounter with the world makes history.</p>
<p class="par">Two people who looked very nice indeed were standing off
regarding Julie with fixed earnestness; a stout and agreeable man with
a thin, transparently amber little lady. Could it be possible that
there were friends for her also on these strange shores? The lady
presented herself as Mrs. Calixter, and her husband as an old friend of
Mr. Dreschell&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">Julie recollected that when her uncle had been forced to
recognize the power of fate he had written to a friend in Manila who
was Collector of the Port, and asked the good offices of himself and
his wife for Julie. Mr. Calixter told her that he and her uncle had
been college friends&mdash;a long time ago; but that, in these pioneer
days, she was given to understand, was a tremendous bond. They informed
Julie hospitably that she should remain with them till she discovered
what was to become of her.</p>
<p class="par">No one over here, Mrs. Calixter explained, had a
definite idea of the next moment. One&rsquo;s fortune lay in flux.
Nothing had yet completely taken shape. The great project unraveled
daily out of destiny and a few men&rsquo;s minds. Fighting was still
going on in some of the islands. The khaki-clad men coming aboard were
from those distant, disordered places, and one could see on their gaunt
faces the shadow of menace and loneliness. The men in plain white
clothes had their struggle too in the making of a civilization
overnight.</p>
<p class="par">An impression of precariousness and uncertainty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>was conveyed to Julie, as if she were about to set
foot upon a forming planet amid widespread restlessness of soul. If she
had dreamed of the improbable, it seemed reasonable that it would
transpire here. In such a place, amid such conditions, ordinary ordered
emotions dropped out of sight. The living of men here was creative, and
at high pressure.</p>
<p class="par">The invitation of the Calixters was a godsend to Julie.
She had been completely vague as to what to do with herself. For the
moment, anyway, she was fixed among these mutabilities.</p>
<p class="par">Launches carried them up the river, past the fort that
once held single-handed the white man&rsquo;s empire of the Pacific.
The stream, meandering to the sea with provoking deliberateness,
carried on its back a strange host, a fantastic floating humanity
ceaselessly and inconjecturably drifting in craft that looked like
dolphins borne from the sea of legends; upstanding boatmen in peaked
hats prodding tiny canopied boats like ivory toys against the stream,
amid the gayeties of the city; trading vessels south-bound for pearls
or spices perhaps, with swart crews, and Eurasian captains on the
bridges.</p>
<p class="par">They landed amid another motley of strange vehicles and
stranger races. The buildings along the wharf were blackened by
smoke-stacks from the Seven Seas. A sun-blistered race of beings,
leaning nonchalantly against pillars and posts, watched, with the deep
tolerance of the East, the influx from the West. This calm, which was
almost awful, gave Julie an uncanny sensation of human futility.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of our fine little mornings on the
equator,&rdquo; Mr. Calixter declared, remarking her wilted expression.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to them.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As she followed the Calixters to their carriage, a
dark-skinned female in scant attire, smoking a cigar as long as a
man&rsquo;s arm, crossed her path. Julie gasped. So many unclothed
creatures going unabashed about their business staggered her. Eons of
consecratedly covered ancestors suffered violence before this exposure.
Mr. Calixter, however, was of the opinion, as he lifted his plump,
perspiring person after her into the carriage, that for apparel in this
climate the human hide was incomparable. But they should all be colored
like Easter eggs, to tell them apart; he could seldom distinguish one
nude brown person from another. It was just possible that we were
dependent to a certain extent on our clothes for individuality.</p>
<p class="par">They drove up into the city through ancient streets
blazoned with sun-lit, vivid houses, quickened with picturesque and
unfamiliar activities, and flowing with a humanity that lived its whole
life open to the universe.</p>
<p class="par">Ceaselessly, strangely, contrastingly, this amazing
humanity throbbed along the thoroughfares like creatures out of Arabian
Nights&rsquo; Tales: carters with their carabaos&mdash;monstrous beasts
of fearful calm, drawing primitive stone wheels through the dust of
ages; turbaned East Indians with bushy beards, offering ivories and
tapestries to the fantastic houses; brown women in pineapple fabrics,
balancing on their heads baskets of Ylang-Ylang for the manufacture of
perfume; a dwarf negrito, enslaved from the forests of the north;
water-carriers; Chinese rice-peddlers; children playing with absurd,
short-tailed cats; babies taking in life at the curbstone from their
mothers&rsquo; breasts. Down these streets in poverty, disease, and
cheerful blindness of soul, marched all the races of the East.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie gasped at what she saw. The riddle of the universe
seemed to be unfolding before her wondering gaze.</p>
<p class="par">She turned from that strange stream of people with their
enigma, their insoluble mystery, to the houses: such startling houses,
intoxicatedly painted like the sunsets over in the sea, and decorated
with all manner of things&mdash;orchids pure as souls; crimson-crested
parrots screaming for the jungle; rain-bow glass; and little
dragons&rsquo; wings.</p>
<p class="par">These were the state chambers of this existence: their
chromatic splendor was reserved for the ceremonies of birth, marriage,
and death; but it was down in the streets that these children of the
sun lived their lives.</p>
<p class="par">There were flashes of queer open shops, cabinets of the
curiosities of the world; showers of wooden shoes suspended from the
ceilings; pink satin coffins; Chinese ginger jars painted with
peacocks; brass church-bells; unleavened bread, universal red pillows,
ornamental brooms that looked like Cleopatra&rsquo;s palm sunshade.
Julie passed them in ecstasy.</p>
<p class="par">Farther on, she had a vision of old walls and moats, and
little stone gates with ancient coats-of-arms above them, and a
surprisingly great number of old stone churches. They were passing now,
Mr. Calixter told her, through the ancient walled city that Legaspi had
built. She saw the priests in their white robes, pacing their high airy
galleries, saying their prayers in the sunlight, above the world. She
drew in with a deep breath the fragrance of the sacred tree of India
that flowered in the monastic gardens.</p>
<p class="par">Pensively, poetically, the conquistador atmosphere still
hung over the heart of the city. Priests and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>armored
captains floated before Julie&rsquo;s mind. In all the pagan <i lang=
"de">hinterland</i> of the East, this was the single Christian citadel,
attacked throughout the ages by land and sea by all the savage hordes
of darkness.</p>
<p class="par">She stared at the tinted oriental domes rearing above
this ancient Christian city, and felt mingling with its priestly
atmosphere the Eleusinian mystery of the East, as if hidden in this
city there were still unconsecrated shrines.</p>
<p class="par">They passed out of the Walled City with its dark
buttresses, its dungeons, its medievally barred doors, its intimations
of eternal age and impenetrable mystery, to the Calixters&rsquo; home
on the sea.</p>
<p class="par">A rainbow scarf of tropical vegetation trailed over this
part of Manila, and Julie caught glimpses of gardens full of the
perfume of dreams, gardens for whose incredible blossoming all the
light in the sun must have been needed.</p>
<p class="par">At luncheon, she cast her first attentive look at her
host and hostess. Beside the splendor of this new planet unrolling
before her, two individuals had not been compelling in interest.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Calixter, it appeared, was a lady from whose being
every particle of flesh had been amazingly subtracted, save just enough
to leave her alive. She had stayed over here to keep Mr. Calixter
company, and in the process had parted ways with her youth. She was
very kind, but very, very tired. This fatigue, she told Julie, had gone
down deep, and would never rest out.</p>
<p class="par">Her husband was plump, and would go good-natured to his
grave. Against such a temperament all climates are powerless. The
tropics had achieved only the rape of his hair. He was so astonishingly
bald that when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>he removed his hat the effect was one of almost
indecent exposure. The hair that refused to remain on his cranium
displayed itself in perfidious and capricious profusion in his
eyebrows, which locked bushily across his forehead.</p>
<p class="par">Julie felt very jolly and very much at home. Mr.
Calixter, during the course of the meal, waved away the most charming
salad of sea-green cucumbers and curling lettuce leaves. He explained
that a lettuce leaf over here might be a death warrant, as cholera was
more or less present all the time&mdash;though that fact could never be
impressed upon the Chinese cook.</p>
<p class="par">Cholera! Julie sat up with a start. In this fairy land
could such a terrible hydra stick up its head? Mr. Calixter told her
about a number of other things that flourished in the islands, things
which she had always categoried as traditions of the Middle
Ages&mdash;small-pox, leprosy on beggars&rsquo; outstretched hands, all
the dreadful medieval list!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a hard uphill pull we have before us over
here, and the top of the mountain nowhere in sight.&rdquo; Mr. Calixter
looked grave.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the natives are fighting us, all over the
islands,&rdquo; Mrs. Calixter remarked, &ldquo;and doing it in a
particularly barbarous and senseless way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you any idea as to where you are
going?&rdquo; Mr. Calixter demanded.</p>
<p class="par">Julie moved restively: &ldquo;No&mdash;but it all sounds
rather awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re aiming to&mdash;and will make
this the finest colony on earth. There are the men here to do it; men
with the genius for pioneering, and a glorious fever to break the
wilderness. The Department of Education is the greatest idea of all.
You must remember <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>that. It is the only thing that will touch
the soul of the people. All the rest, just yet, seems to fall
outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are hosts of interesting people
here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Calixter, smiling cryptically. &ldquo;People
with histories made over night, and making history themselves
splendidly, too. Perhaps you will stay in Manila. At any rate, you will
catch an unforgettable glimpse of&mdash;all this, as you flit through.
This afternoon, late, we will drive on the Luneta, where you will see a
cross section of the whole East. Later, we are to go to a ball. All the
empire-builders will be there. So keep your young soul
awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After luncheon everybody mysteriously disappeared. Julie
was left alone in the silent, hot, perfumed world. Not a sound came to
her from anywhere; existence seemed suspended. What had become of the
contents of the world?</p>
<p class="par">She decided to open up her baggage&mdash;which, thanks
to Mr. Calixter, had already arrived&mdash;and lay out the dress she
should need for the evening. After five o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Calixter
had said, Manila drove forth in full dress to the Luneta. Julie
gathered up a ball gown and went over to the glass to appraise its
relationship to herself. She was enchanted with the maturity of the
garment. Through it she and the world met at last; it suggested the
finally opened door of the universe in which she was free to find her
dreams. She whirled, a gay dervish, in front of her mirror.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly she stopped, awed by the strange reflection she
saw of herself. Odd multiplied personages attenuated from it. She
couldn&rsquo;t begin to think that she knew them, though each at an
angle offered some startling familiarity. She had merely wished to
exact <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>from the mirror reassurance of her woman&rsquo;s
incontestable inheritance, but these strange images carried her out of
the background of the glass into a boundless territory of
conjecture.</p>
<p class="par">Motionless now she beheld reflected a unique, youthful
face framed by silvery blond hair, with a pair of green eyes of unusual
hue, while flung upon the face, as upon a screen, was an abstraction of
personality like a superimposed self. This abstract personality
revealed itself tangibly, on occasions, in a transfiguration of light
disclosing something inscrutable, eternal, and absolute.</p>
<p class="par">A cryptic sentence of her aunt&rsquo;s flashed through
her mind. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a singular thing that comes into your
face&mdash;&rdquo; which was followed by another, &ldquo;You think, you
are strong. It will take many a road to show you that you are
not.&rdquo; That old subjection was over now, forever. Julie shivered a
little.</p>
<p class="par">She went back to her unpacking; but as she drew out the
airy charming dresses a sudden dissatisfaction with them seized her.
Their expensive beauty was all wrong. She had seen at once that pioneer
women garb themselves very plainly for the day&rsquo;s work&mdash;and
her work indubitably was to be of the plainest.</p>
<p class="par">For particulars concerning a suitable wardrobe, Julie
had consulted a schoolmate back home, the daughter of an army officer,
who in her eighteen years had never bought a garment of her own. The
inspired inventory they had worked out together Julie might, she now
felt, have to reckon with later as a force of fate. Her aunt having
been called away to the bedside of a sister, Julie, the reins quite
off, had gone in quest of clothes as if she were walking the Milky Way,
looking for free stars. She had selected and bought in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>glory of
mood that beheld the world at her disposal. An exultant thing, this
wardrobe of rejoicing garments that fairly caroled the elated moods of
youth. Quite the wardrobe with which to set out to conquer the
world.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared at it. The fatality of that delicate mass!
Her uncle&rsquo;s face, aghast at the riddle he appeared to confront in
her, rose before her. And the bitter complication of bills that could
not be met, huge heedless bills that he had told her in his desperation
she must somehow face. There wasn&rsquo;t a thing in the world he could
do for her any more. He would get somebody to lend her the money for
the present; which would amount to an actual mortgage upon her
existence, with so small a salary and with her agent&rsquo;s commission
to pay. &ldquo;Poor little Argonaut,&rdquo; he had called her,
&ldquo;setting out with the intuition of a nineteen-year-old girl as a
divining rod of the world, ignorant of the values of money or
men!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie closed the door rudely on the dresses, and slipped
downstairs to seek brighter diversion in the hot, fragrant world.</p>
<p class="par">She passed admiringly the statue of the Godmother of the
New World, standing in her sweeping robes looking out across the sea to
the Spanish Main. Splendidly believing Isabel, whose faith in the
vision of a Genoese captain gave a new world to men!</p>
<p class="par">Just beyond were two school houses. Julie wondered
wistfully if she would be assigned to one of them. It would be very
lovely, in this flower-scented spot, right under the shadow of the
ancient stone church across the street, to bring wisdom to this people.
She smiled at herself. How much of the world&rsquo;s wisdom had she,
young, terribly young thing that she was? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>She moved meditatively
toward the church, scents of tropical flowers on every side of her.</p>
<p class="par">The church was of aged gray and battered stone, with the
single white effigy of a saint guarding the worn entrance. There was
moss in every crevice of its strong sides, which stood out like great
gaunt ribs. Near by, in a wild area of sun-dried grass, was the
refectory, ruthlessly severe in its economy of lumber. The resistless
fecundity of the tropics encroached upon all this grimness; vines were
flowering over the frowning vortices.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stepped through the faded green door. At once the
hot world slipped behind her. In the dim shadowiness, she stood staring
wonderingly about. She had been in Catholic churches many times, but
this was like none of them. The gray pillars were painted with the
sunset colors of the East. The dome, full of stars and suns and
portraits of the Deity, suggested a rather crowded Mohammedan Heaven.
The altar, shining silver twenty feet high, was gorgeously hand-carved,
and upon it, in white brocaded satin and pearls, stood Mary. In one of
the smaller naves, there was a small statue of Christ, terribly
sweating blood.</p>
<p class="par">Julie tiptoed across the bare stone flags. A couple of
women were kneeling in the silence, and one or two tragically old men,
slowly and painfully with wrinkled hands telling their beads. The women
were with child; the old men, their own concern done, prayed for the
world.</p>
<p class="par">To the right of the altar, she heard a soft murmur of
sounds, where in a side chapel a priest in a black cassock stood by a
font administering the baptismal service to a tiny brown baby in a very
long pink satin robe. The godmother held the baby, while the barefooted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>native mother stood apart. Another Christian into
the fold! Julie was struck by the priest&rsquo;s face, the fine pity he
turned upon the futile little brown mite.</p>
<p class="par">Julie moved on. As she was about to step out, the priest
passed her. She stopped him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May I ask the name of this church?&rdquo; she
faltered uncertainly. What she wanted to ask was the significance of it
all.</p>
<p class="par">A tired shadow crossed the priest&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Saint Francis Xavier&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. Then he stood and
looked about him, and the shadow grew.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is beautifully decorated,&rdquo; Julie
ventured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is one of the Christian churches of the
Orient,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is this the first one you have
seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I only arrived to-day. I am stopping with the
Calixters. I am a teacher.&rdquo; She added this a little proudly.</p>
<p class="par">His manner altered. &ldquo;The Calixters are friends and
parishioners of mine. You are the young lady they told me they were
expecting. I am Father Hull.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly he made a gesture to the gorgeous mystery about
him. &ldquo;You are not a Catholic? Then this can not break your heart.
Did you expect,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to find a bonze in here dealing
paper prayers?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then, with an abrupt change of manner, he asked her
about her work. She told him she had no idea where it would be.
Everybody over here seemed to be very busy; it would no doubt be real
work and hard. She told him na&iuml;vely about her old ambition to go
as a nun to the Leper Islands.</p>
<p class="par">He shook his head. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said,
regarding her with a sudden keen penetration, &ldquo;that you will not
go very far away. I have been a soldier, as well as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>a
priest. I have tramped through the jungles of many of the
islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Will you stay here all your life?&rdquo; she
asked in awe.</p>
<p class="par">The priest looked at the blazing landscape. His
shoulders drooped. Finally he said, &ldquo;Where on earth is the priest
of God so needed as in this wilderness of darkened souls? If I can ever
serve you, let me know.&rdquo; He turned toward the stark rectory.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stood on the spot, and watched the black cassock
disappear.</p>
<p class="par">Rousing herself, she walked down the street, stopping to
peep wonderingly over the tops of old walls at the contents of gardens,
at gay dwellings gleaming like bright fruit or gorgeous birds&rsquo;
eggs out of the giant foliage. Before one house, most orientally
imposing of them all, Julie stopped in amazement.</p>
<p class="par">This dwelling was so extraordinarily different from her
conception of human habitations that her fancy coupled it with pillared
pagodas. It was painted in a number of strong colors, which, as in none
other of these strange houses, made a singularly stirring harmony, even
in the spectrum of startlingly tinted pillars supporting the great
galleries. Orchids&mdash;elfin, super-mundane faces, and air-plants,
free from the bondage of the earth, swung like stars in the soft
evening wind from the balconies.</p>
<p class="par">Strange flowers, mysteriously unfolding in the treetops,
showered the coming twilight with a delirious fragrance. All about the
boundaries of the garden towered cocoanut palms, looking with their
clean trunks like magic beanstalks leading to higher regions; on the
ground were large, brown cocoanuts, their milk spilling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>over the
earth. Ripe fruit hung from many trees; bananas, like huge golden
branches, and a strange fruit that looked like little green hedgehogs
hanging upside down in the high foliage.</p>
<p class="par">Over the garden the light of the lowering sun lay now
like the glow of Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp, illuminating it to supernatural
dimensions. Over in one end of it a little grizzled Malay dwarf,
perfect in his proportions even to his uplifted tiny hands, with the
aid of a device on a long pole, was cutting flowers from the tops of
bushes and trees. Julie, staring at the surprising little being and not
perfectly sure what he could be, saw him examine with intentness the
insides of the flowers as they fell, as though he might expect to find
wrapped up in the great blossoms another of his kind. A young monkey
danced down a tree-trunk, and commenced scattering the dwarf&rsquo;s
store. The mannikin pounced upon him, and whimsically thrust one of the
golden bells of blossoms upside down on the little furry head.</p>
<p class="par">Of a surety this was a Caliph&rsquo;s mansion. Julie
gazed in longingly, venturing at last inside the gate. In a Chinese
ginger-jar a little yellow flower caught her eye. In this oriental and
magic garden to find so strange, so alien a thing as an English
primrose blooming! It was not a very robust primrose; indeed it was
faint and small. Yet clearly it was more carefully tended than anything
else in the garden.</p>
<p class="par">Out of a green and bronze lodge a keeper emerged to
investigate her. The sun of the East had burned him to all but a
cinder. Humbly respectful, he waited for her to speak. Julie explained
in broken Spanish that the garden was so beautiful that she had been
tempted to enter. She would like to know who lived in this little
kingdom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The queer old wrinkled creature looked quizzically at
her, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Una hija del pais</i>,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A daughter of the country!&rdquo; What ever could
the old man mean by this cryptic reply? She looked about
hesitatingly.</p>
<p class="par">Just then from the indiscernible depths of the great
house, an arm decorated with a wide gold band thrust itself out of a
cloud of long, black hair, and pushed back the half-opened sliding
shutter. A darkly beautiful figure appeared up there. In response to a
gesture from it, the keeper strode toward the balcony. The figure spoke
to him, and he turned back to Julie.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My Mistress says that the garden is at your
disposal, and for you to go where you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie moved curiously a few steps toward the balcony.
The gold bands on the arms of the princess up there glistened
alluringly down at her. A flashing brunette face came out of the shadow
of the dense, splendid sweep of hair. It looked down out of a startling
and incongruous pair of violet eyes. As this personality was not at all
the setting for them, Julie wondered how they had come about.</p>
<p class="par">They played upon the girl with a flame of interest, but
their possessor did not speak. Conversation, Julie reflected, was not
perhaps included among the gifts of Eastern women. This woman, she
felt, had more subtle modes of expression. With her deep, understanding
silence, her flashing disclosures in gestures and glance, speech would
no doubt be a tardy revelation. Her sense of repose disquieted Julie,
reminding her in its singular quiescence of that human becalmment that
had at the first so disturbed her in this land. The blue eyes further
perturbed her with their interrogations&mdash;unanswerable questions:
Why she had come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>into this atmosphere, and what she dared to think
she would achieve in it. The Caliphess in the balcony managed to convey
an impression of proprietorship to this sphere, and to exact some sort
of explanation for Julie&rsquo;s appearance in it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am a stranger&mdash;&rdquo; Julie began
&ldquo;&mdash;it is all very wonderful to me&rdquo;; she paused and
looked around her with a sense of inadequateness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I knew that you did not belong
here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The woman above spoke at last, using England&rsquo;s
English, with once in a while the flicker of some strange intonation,
like the out-cropping of a subconscious tone. &ldquo;But where did you
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The States&mdash;San Francisco!&rdquo; Julie
replied.</p>
<p class="par">A change flashed across the mobile twilight face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They keep coming! What,&rdquo; after a pause,
&ldquo;do you expect to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie did not reply at once. Ah, that was asking the
riddle! Her gaze roamed over the wondrous garden and palace. The sphinx
above read the look.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This garden,&rdquo; she informed Julie,
&ldquo;has been here for centuries&mdash;and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So of course it wouldn&rsquo;t do me any good to
want it!&rdquo; Julie laughed outright. &ldquo;And, you see, I am quite
awfully poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you come to&mdash;take something&mdash;all of
them do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie sobered. &ldquo;I came&mdash;but of course you
wouldn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;I came&mdash;&rdquo; She sought for the
articulation of the high and splendid mission. Words came forth
disjointedly when she sought to give form to that inner fervor. The
lady in the balcony listened, and as she listened to the halting speech
a change passed through her blue eyes and vanished. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p class="par">Julie replied that she was nineteen.</p>
<p class="par">A frown came between the splendid brows. &ldquo;That is
not young in the East. We begin early to experience over here. We are
not afraid of life. We do not keep the young half their existence in
swaddling clothes. It is only too plain that you are not a woman, in
spite of your years&mdash;and the things that you are inconceivably set
upon doing. Perhaps you are married.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie flushed. &ldquo;You see, I was considered still
too young for that. I was in school.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you learn in that school to live
life&mdash;here? Ah, I think not. And you may go any place, and to any
thing. You were not old enough to be married or to live your own
life&mdash;but you were old enough to attempt&mdash;this fearful thing.
My friend, go back to your home. You are too young. It is written in
your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I have no home anywhere. All this wonder is
yours; how fortunate above fortune you are!&rdquo; Julie looked
wistfully up at her from the ground.</p>
<p class="par">The lady receded a little from the balcony, and the
shadows dropped heavily on the twilight face. &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Again she spoke. &ldquo;What is your name? I want to see
you again. One does not see every day a little Atlas who is going to
lift the world on its back. You promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie sped through the gold-tipped shadows. Mrs.
Calixter was late in her dressing, and Julie was so concerned over the
low-necked gown that she had been commanded to wear for the drive on
the Luneta, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>and so concerned later over what she saw when she
got there, that she forgot for the time to ask about the garden and its
fair owner.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Luneta is an open-air reception in this one
wonderful hour of the day, my dear. Did you have a nice nap?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie smiled. Naps at nineteen, when every moment
counts!</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Calixter regarded pensively this freshness of the
dawn. &ldquo;May it be the top of the morning to you always! Look at
me.&rdquo; She pointed to her bloodless face and sun-faded hair.
&ldquo;The East drinks you up after a while, body and soul. We&rsquo;re
dust that God needs to breathe on again. Don&rsquo;t let it swallow
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s marvelous though, like a dream,&rdquo;
Julie murmured. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll never wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Luneta proved to be an elliptical drive,
picturesquely verging upon the sea. The winds and the water at this
hour contrived to make it the single cool spot in the city.</p>
<p class="par">A native band, led by a remarkable negro musician,
played haunting music of the sorrows and loves of the earth. The drone
of the waves lashing upon the rocks mingled with the melody. The sun
setting behind an island over in the sea, fantastically enkindled the
city, making it appear with its gleaming domes like some citadel of the
unbeliever reclaimed in this Crusaders&rsquo; light. Julie had never
seen such deep and powerful colors. They stunned her mind, yet
engendered in her a strange exhilaration, a subtle invitation to plunge
behind those shadowy walls and follow their secret. The light shivered
into shadows; the falling night dropped enchantment over the city.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Carriages swept by with the races of the earth in them;
quiet-faced Englishmen staring pensively out to sea as if to discern in
the distance a certain blessed island that lay over there; Spaniards
with brooding, Moor-like faces, adventuring still in the East after
their country had withdrawn forever out of the New World;
close-cropped, investigatory Germans, eager traders all over the East;
native families of the better class, dressed stiffly in European
costume&mdash;a concession to the new age&mdash;and riding proudly
behind American horses; Chinese women in jade and brocade, beside their
funereally garbed husbands; East Indians, Japanese, Anamese, Koreans,
Armenians&mdash;and faces that belonged to no race or clime,
intermediates of the white, dark and yellow peoples, circling round the
edges of this phantasmagoria like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps. And last,
there were feverishly alive Americans, with an inexpressible urgency in
their attitude&mdash;soldiers of the empire, here to make their
fortunes and the fortune of the land.</p>
<p class="par">It was a little frightening, this hodge-podge of
stranger peoples met at a single point out of the world. Julie noticed
how few American women there were. The land was still too tumultuous
for their advent. She faced nervously the curiosity of so many men.</p>
<p class="par">Every face was counted in Manila, Mrs. Calixter told
her.</p>
<p class="par">A great many carriages stopped to visit with Mrs.
Calixter. Julie saw one passing, which of all the procession claimed
her attention. A tall young man with a tawny head from which he had
swept his hat rode in it&mdash;his face turned to the sea winds.</p>
<p class="par">Julie looked, and wondered. Who could he be? In this
cavalcade that vivid personality of power and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>strength
blazed indelibly apart. When he turned his face, a recollection of a
child&rsquo;s highest dreams flashed through her sensibilities in a
single word&mdash;Excelsior! She could not have explained how his
youthful stirring face had recalled that supreme childish fervor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; she asked. It was so clear that
he was somebody of note in this world.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Calixter followed her gaze. &ldquo;A Prince of the
East,&rdquo; she said whimsically. &ldquo;An Irish-American
Haroun-al-Raschid, na&iuml;vely engaged in the recrudescence of the
East. We call him The Mayor of Manila. He believes that it shall
transcend all other cities of the earth; he pours himself and his
substance out over it. We are going to his home to-night. He gives
entertainments famous all over the Archipelago&mdash;and is a
bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry McChord is one of the most striking of all
the empire-builders,&rdquo; added Mr. Calixter. &ldquo;He is determined
to make this colony a gospel of conviction to the East. We are the
beacon, he believes, which has come to light the darkness. We are to
fire the dead ancient nations into immortal life, and make the East one
sublimated republic. You can understand how a young and Quixotic man
with such tremendous ideas does remarkable things. He has a hand
literally in everything&mdash;in education, public health,
illumination, public gardens, schemes for first-class hotels to replace
Eastern inns, the development of the university, hospitals and
theaters. Manila is the theater in which he is staging his Far Eastern
drama. When his play of sublimated Eastern civilization is ready, he
will summon all Asia to attend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As they drove away, detaching themselves from the human
caravansary, Julie looked back upon the rough <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>and
struggling mass of humanity which was wresting destiny out of the
standardless East, and sensed over all the exiles a pervading
pensiveness, an air of waiting till the stroke of fate should open the
gate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Mayor of Manila lived in the Walled City,
although most Americans had chosen the space and coolness of the
outside districts.</p>
<p class="par">His house was very old, and stood close to the ancient
walls, overlooking the ocean. Its gardens lifted the graceful shadows
of trees over the tops of the high lichened walls and out into the
world. The house was in the ecclesiastical locality that had so
strangely impressed Julie that afternoon.</p>
<p class="par">In company with the Calixters, she entered the inclosed
estate and found herself beneath the towering shadow of a great white
house rearing so high above the walls that the glow of light pouring
from the opened window spaces of the upper regions seemed almost to
belong to the starred canopy of the night.</p>
<p class="par">These upper regions presented an appearance of spacious
stately halls with very high ceilings and brilliantly polished floors.
Pieces of handsomely carved Spanish furniture were disposed about the
room, and some huge darkened paintings of Spanish captains who had come
this way hung on the walls.</p>
<p class="par">The people, however, made the atmosphere of these rooms.
At first, Julie thought she was in a dream. People from all the
unheard-of places of the earth seemed collected here. Such queer little
brown women, moving about on their fairy feet, in long gorgeous trains,
like gay little peacocks; and their men, mailed in European evening
dress&mdash;as if it were armor donned for the eternal triumph of
civilization. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>Most of them were painfully polite, Julie thought;
with a touch of humility in their politeness. Spain had not been very
long gone, and even <i lang="es">mestizos</i> and rich Filipinos had
not figured in her social lists.</p>
<p class="par">The Sultan of Sulu, temporarily absent from his own
dominions, appeared much satisfied with the stir he and his
preposterous pearls were creating. &ldquo;Holy Mary! Such as the very
gates of Heaven are made of!&rdquo; one dusky maiden exclaimed in
rapture.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An illiterate Malay, making an artistic
collection of wives, and deliberately decking himself out with those
things as a decoy. He&rsquo;s perfectly odious,&rdquo; Mrs. Calixter
declared.</p>
<p class="par">Julie saw diamonds as big as hen&rsquo;s eggs on these
brown nabob&rsquo;s wives, but the pearls dramatically obscured
everything else.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of Barry McChord,&rdquo;
murmured Mrs. Calixter, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t subscribe to some of
his guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Their host was discovered in the front room, a blond
young man moving around the room in a white mess jacket. He came across
to greet them.</p>
<p class="par">Julie looked up to the face she had seen on the Luneta,
the gay, young <i>excelsior</i> face with the vivid hair, through which
he stressfully rumpled his fingers as he talked.</p>
<p class="par">He had an ardor of being that communicated itself
electrically to those around him. Julie felt suddenly on fire again. He
looked attentively at her, as if there were something about her that
called up some association. She wondered how he came to be so strong
and so magnificent, and to attain this golden blaze of power out of
which he shone like a prince.</p>
<p class="par">They were separated before they could have anything
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>to say to each other. Mrs. Calixter wanted Julie
to meet somebody &ldquo;very special.&rdquo; As that was precisely what
she had been doing, Julie wondered why she had to be led away.</p>
<p class="par">Streams of fantastic people blocked their way.
Refreshments made into the most fanciful forms were proffered them from
great nara wood tables, such as might have served for a medi&aelig;val
feast. Every one was going about his own picturesque business;
love-making was coming into play down under the lanterns in the
gardens, where the native musicians were making music to draw
one&rsquo;s heart out of one&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p class="par">In the midst of a sudden bursting triumphal strain,
Julie stopped to behold what she believed to be a queen, with her
train&mdash;a woman of such an opulent type of beauty, of such vivid
tones of costume and improbable profusion of jewels, that the eye for
an instant was overwhelmed. Mrs. Calixter whispered that this was the
famous Isabel Armistead, known all over the Orient as &ldquo;The
Empress of the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Julie exclaimed, staring at her
amazed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the lady from the Caliph&rsquo;s
garden!&rdquo; She explained vividly her chance visit of the
afternoon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A caliphess indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Calixter
agreed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And of course she would look like that,&rdquo;
Julie declared. &ldquo;Oh! tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She is a strange creature, certainly,&rdquo; Mrs.
Calixter said. &ldquo;Her father was an Englishman, I believe; her
mother, one of those unanalyzable mixtures of strains you find over
here. I think they were married to legitimatize Isabel, whose beauty
and brilliance were remarkable. She has had the best of education
abroad, and is, without the shadow of a doubt, the most deeply clever
woman in the East&mdash;as well as one of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>richest;
for from the submerged mother she received one of the great insular
fortunes. At seventeen she was married to Richard Armistead, a
middle-aged Englishman of first-rate family, who for years held an
important position as head of a bank here. He is in England now, for
his health; and there are very strong indications that he will not come
back. I imagine Isabel has a way of disposing of inconveniences. That
is not so difficult here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, what do you mean? She hasn&rsquo;t hurt
anybody, has she?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not that I know of. But when people are in the
way over here, they are just put out of it.&rdquo; Mrs. Calixter
dropped her voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman over there&mdash;quite
beautiful, you see&mdash;with no sign about her of being a daughter of
the land, yet when she wanted another husband she managed to bring it
about. She and the man she wanted, so Mrs. Roxas will tell you, the two
of them, just did for poor Tony. He was delicate, and they merely made
him die somehow. Yet nobody ever fastened anything on to them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is the land of the new chance. Men and women
who never found their chance at home, or who debauched it, are seeking
their Eldorado here. Standards, social and moral, are easier here than
at home. There&rsquo;s a lawlessness of soul that hangs heavy in the
atmosphere. You are too young to see it yet. Even the girls are quite
vivid&mdash;and inimitably experienced. Whether it is so or not, they
give one the impression always of taking the most perilous
chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She looked penetratingly into Julie&rsquo;s breathlessly
intent face. &ldquo;My dear, you are neither old enough nor strong
enough to encounter Manila&mdash;a city three centuries old quickened
by a new population&mdash;new wine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>in old bottles! That&rsquo;s why
I don&rsquo;t want you to remain over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; Julie murmured with
shining eyes &ldquo;&mdash;like an Arabian Nights&rsquo; dream. I do so
want to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Calixter&rsquo;s attention reverted to Isabel, who
stood not far away. She said that Isabel had been loved by many men of
many races, and like an empress of the East, she loved them royally for
a day, and then flung them aside. A woman whose blood was part of the
East, part of the West&mdash;nobody knew just where the division lay.
Mrs. Calixter stopped as she saw Isabel approaching. She was looking at
Julie.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this,&rdquo; she asked, greeting Mrs.
Calixter, &ldquo;my young acquaintance of this afternoon? I feared when
she walked out so radiantly into the shadows that that might be the
last of her that I should see.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie, looking across into the flashing face, concluded
that she had never seen anybody who intimated so many human
possibilities&mdash;unless it were the young host of this occasion.
Isabel fascinated her, and made her feel as if some queer Sybil of the
Eastern bazaars were summoning her down secret streets.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will like Manila very much,&rdquo; said
Isabel, drawing nearer to Julie as Mrs. Calixter turned to speak to
some one else. &ldquo;Perhaps you will find what you are
seeking&mdash;they all seek, whatever they say. But there is always the
joy of the day. You Americans are forever trying to steal to-morrow.
See that you get your share of the hours and minutes&mdash;and come to
my house again, as soon as you get your assignment. I know the islands,
every spot they could send you to. Do this,&rdquo; she urged, with an
insistence that captured Julie. Her train swept her onward.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie suddenly saw their host come out and accost Isabel
in the glowing spot under the central lamps. He bowed laughingly before
her, and Isabel&rsquo;s warm, enchanting face swept off in the dance,
close to his. Julie paused thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">A handsome girl in shining blue gauze stepped up to her,
and was presented by Mrs. Calixter as Ellis Wilbur.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry says that you have just arrived, and that I
must tell you about everything. I think he meant everybody. It must all
be so bewildering and strange, and so hard to catch up with. Leave her
in my hands,&rdquo;&mdash;Ellis turned to Mrs.
Calixter&mdash;&ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t for anything say the things
I&rsquo;m going to, and I don&rsquo;t pretend that it won&rsquo;t be
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Reverting to Julie, with an air of light concern, she
went on: &ldquo;I hope you are not going to any of those dreadful
little islands where they are sending such tragically unsuspecting
teachers. Papa and I have visited some particularly atrocious
ones&mdash;the Mohammedan group, away south, my dear, and so called
because they live right up to the worst tenets of the Prophet. Moros
are a nerve-shattering experience, they literally bristle with knives;
and are always breaking out into massacres. It&rsquo;s too big an
emotion for me to seek the wilderness. But over here the game seems
usually to over-shadow the risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Miss Wilbur&rsquo;s gaze, which had roved to the dancers
became suddenly alert. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;Isabel
blooming like the &lsquo;Song of Songs&rsquo;! Have I a terrible little
inkling of what that might mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For whom does Isabel bloom?&rdquo; Julie demanded
curiously.</p>
<p class="par">But the quaintly disclosive Miss Wilbur became
unaccountably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>reticent. She remarked carelessly: &ldquo;Isabel
cares transcendently for that Ancient of Days, herself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If Leah Chamberlain,&rdquo; she went on in an
unchanged tone, &ldquo;would come in skirts up to her knees, she would
create a much more unlabored effect than she is at present attempting
with those classic black silken limbs of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For Julie&rsquo;s enlightenment, she pointed out a woman
with flaming hair and spectacular eyes, who seemed altogether too
resplendent for the ordinary purposes of life.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Leah keeps the emotion of the Empire
astir,&rdquo; Miss Wilbur declared. &ldquo;She is one of its phases.
She lives in a flame always, and transcends the bonds of mere husbands
and other things. The husband, a drab creature, lives in barracks out
of town. Leah puts up at the Oriente and spreads her splendid wings.
What are the feelings of a gold-tipped goddess anyway? Lovell is bent
Burmese fashion before her&mdash;Lovell is a bank-man in Hongkong who
is about to come into a big title. He aspires, at cross purposes, to
power and to Leah.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A woman with dark hair drawn over a glistening pearl of
a face passed on the arm of a plump, florid man. &ldquo;Another Woman
of the Empire. That Madonna face, my dear, has seen the floor of hell.
That woman has experienced the deepest brutality of the East. She was a
little New England factory girl, whom her profligate lover abandoned in
a Chinese port. In her Hegira, she found her way here, and became one
of the famous white <i>hetirae</i> of the city. That&rsquo;s what they
amount to here, and along the coast. When you see particularly handsome
women driving alone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31</a>]</span>along the Luneta, don&rsquo;t ask who they
are. Abernathy came along and married her, right out of the district
where they live, and now she has a great house, with all the money in
the world. But as isolated as if she were in a cave. I went there once,
and she took me up on her high lonely roof, from which she said she
could look out over the city and watch it marching ahead. Her heart was
breaking with loneliness; the old days when she ruled men were gone,
but she wanted to see this thing through. Just another obscure sentinel
who is sticking to her post.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have an idea that Mrs. Calixter has been
telling you things about the women. She doesn&rsquo;t
understand&mdash;her generation can&rsquo;t&mdash;that they&rsquo;ve
got the chance, and the second chance, over here. They can do a lot and
get away with it&mdash;and no hair-lines drawn. But they have freedom
of choice&mdash;they can make or break themselves. A few, of course,
are clear outside&mdash;like Isabel, who has nobody to account to and
to whom not even the roughest rules apply. She is one of the laws here
herself. Don&rsquo;t try to measure her by rule of thumb, she
hasn&rsquo;t any measure; Isabel has more freedom of will than it is
safe to think about. She is moreover staggeringly rich&mdash;and
helpful; and I see as much of her as she will allow&mdash;although
papa, who belongs to Mrs. Calixter&rsquo;s tiresome era, is inclined to
discourage this intimacy. Yet I have discovered,&rdquo; Miss Wilbur
asserted calmly, &ldquo;that he goes privately and takes tea with her.
He considers it a very dashing experience, no doubt. She probably tells
him a great deal about the Islands, which he believes like gospel. That
is he.&rdquo; Miss Wilbur gestured carelessly toward a distinguished
looking white-haired gentleman. &ldquo;So diplomatic-looking,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>everybody says! Papa has &lsquo;represented&rsquo;
at two courts, and he was completely taken aback when they put him on a
democratic job like this. He&rsquo;s on the Commission. But he has
caught the fire, like the rest. He is having a very disconcerting
second blooming. I used to conceive of papa as a sort of ancient,
delicate epigram, and behold, he has come to life! That flower in his
button-hole is what they call here the &lsquo;Chain of
Love.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A pleasant, worn-faced Englishman in a singular
semi-uniform costume, with a dark sash knotted around his waist, bowed
to Miss Wilbur.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That sash? Nobody knows what it means. Perhaps
it&rsquo;s an emblem of the Republic of the Sun&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
fantastic name somebody has given to the impossible Utopia that these
men are trying to bring about in the East, after Campanelli&rsquo;s or
Plato&rsquo;s dream; I forgot which. They believe the East is to awaken
tremendously. Talk with Barry about it. But this gentleman,
Matfield-Barron, broods over the situation with all the lonely passion
of the expatriate; it&rsquo;s the last thing left in his soul. Most of
the others mean, like the Chinamen, to &lsquo;go back&rsquo; after the
day is over, but Matfield-Barron will stay on. He was an officer in the
British army, and was cashiered out of the service over in
India&mdash;something about a woman, who is said to have used him as a
shield for another man. So he drifted here. I hope for his sake they
don&rsquo;t break the Scheme, back there in the States. I can&rsquo;t
bear to think of that homeless wanderer growing old in the East with no
Utopia to love. And I&rsquo;m crazy about that absurd sash! It waves a
breezy, Anglo-Saxon defiance to the apathy of the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A blond, blunt man who looked like a shortened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>Hercules exchanged a word with Julie&rsquo;s
companion, and walked on.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Holborne&mdash;organized the
Constabulary; says he&rsquo;s an Englishman&mdash;born in Malta, rather
an interesting place to be born in. I think that Holborne is a true
soldier of fortune, and that when a bigger fight comes up he will move
on. Rumor has it that he is bound up in Isabel&rsquo;s spokes; but so
many men are that! It is written in his steel eyes that no woman shall
upset his universe.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But of course the main force in this unseen
republic is Barry McChord. He is the Titan stoking this furnace. He is
one of those persons you want to have around&mdash;he makes the world
so exciting to live in! He has gone mad over this rough-and-tumble
colony, and over the whole East. He&rsquo;s in love with the torn-up
landscape, the scaffoldings, the skeleton bridges, and diverted rivers.
Cleaning, rehabilitating, straining&mdash;he is trying to carry the
East on his back!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And now I must relinquish this personally
conducted tour,&rdquo; Miss Wilbur concluded; &ldquo;I see a circle of
prospective partners frowning at me for having hedged you in so long.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter, however; for the dancing is only just getting
under way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As Ellis Wilbur had implied, young men got themselves
brought up, and claimed Julie. Diffident, high-colored Englishmen,
whimsically satirical over the paradoxes of the East, or wearily
skeptical; her own countrymen, gloriously beginning and flushed with
the enterprise. These last had come to civilize Asia, and made one feel
that they were electrified with their job; they had the air of being
engaged in a national knight-errantcy. Their mood kept the air stirred.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>Julie was bewildered by all they found to tell
her&mdash;strange recitals that made an Odyssey of the hopes and
ambitions of many men. It set up in her a fresh excitement.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly, looking up, she found her host before her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It has been quite impossible to get near you. I
have sought you once as my guest, again as the very newest lady, and
several times after that because I seem to have remembered you some
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps that all comes of my being
so new. To-morrow I shall have dwindled back into
proportion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come and take a walk on the gallery,&rdquo; he
invited; &ldquo;I want to show you the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They passed through a doorway out to a high gallery that
brought them suddenly very close to the stars. Julie faced them as
astonished as if a corner of the sky had been unpinned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do these belong to your garden?&rdquo; she asked
laughingly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To my Neighbor&rsquo;s Country.&rdquo; He smiled.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t transgress.&rdquo; He laid his hand on a dark line
of stones. &ldquo;Here are the walls. They keep the Pacific out of my
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A stone&rsquo;s throw over the walls Julie saw the
purple stretches of the ocean that used to come gloriously rushing
through her gate of golden dreams. She listened a moment to its roar
rising above the music in the garden. Then she stared over the city.
Before her, mysterious, shadowy, inexorable, the ancient ramparts rose,
inclosing a black, fantastic city with unearthly towers and domes. A
city of fate!</p>
<p class="par">The girl shivered with mingled ecstasy and fear.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why do you live here? You might have chosen other
cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So might you&mdash;but there was destiny. I chose
Manila for many reasons&mdash;some of them hardly definable. There was
something from the first that spoke out to me from it, that whispered
from every one of its old stones&mdash;an atmosphere of profound human
struggle, as if for centuries the place had been battling with forces
that go back into the dark borderland of human genesis. The human
spirit at its darkest, lowest ebb. It seems to me that is the curse
that we have come to lift&mdash;the curse of the whole East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you been here very long?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Almost since the beginning, the Year One with
us&mdash;&rdquo; He rested his arm upon the surface of the wall, and
looked across at the stretches of singing waters just beyond.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Would you like to hear how I came?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s been telling
me to-night how they happened to come, but most of all I want to hear
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was fate with me. I was shipwrecked off the
coast of Mindanao in a typhoon. I had been trading up and down the
East, here and there, with headquarters in China. I had been round the
earth, and I had seen most of the cities, but I had never seen the one
that I believed was my particular fate. I&rsquo;d always had ideas of
what I wanted to do in the world, but I&rsquo;d never gotten much
nearer than dreaming them. Then came the shipwreck and the whole New
World for me. We were rescued by the Moros and were traded round among
them for a while. They led us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>along the tops of stony mountains and
told us every day when the sun went down that that was the last of it
we would ever see. A couple of our men died. After we&rsquo;d been led
about for months and our <i>datto</i> had made up his mind to kill us,
his force was attacked by another chieftain. We bolted straight into
the jungle, and nearly went crazy getting out. Finally in an open boat
we gained the sea, and just drifted until we reached a town where a
commercial steamer had put in. I got aboard, and came upon this city,
and here in this unexpected corner of the earth I found my countrymen
engaged in the biggest thing I&rsquo;d ever seen.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I knew right off that it was here that I
belonged, and that this city was my fate. A boat was going out for
Shanghai with the captain of it a friend of mine, and he wanted to take
me on; my affairs had been going well across the China Sea. But I told
him good-by&mdash;I had decided to take my chances along with the rest
of my people.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I started in with a trading company that knew my
firm, and I showed them what I&rsquo;d learned about selling goods to
the Chinese&mdash;you see I knew all the big Chinese concerns. I got to
be a partner and then I bought the other fellows out&mdash;and so I
came to do the things I&rsquo;d set my heart upon. I&rsquo;m Irish, you
see, Irish-American, and my heart had burned with all sorts of
things.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he interrogated suddenly.
&ldquo;Did those green eyes lead you East? They are like the jade of a
temple god&mdash;the color of the farthest reach of the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie smiled dreamily. &ldquo;When I was a child this
same ocean used to flow in from across the world <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>and tell
me stories of some of the lands it touched. I knew a long time ago that
I was to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And how did you get to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am to teach!&rdquo; and she stopped, wondering
within herself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, there are simply no limits to that. Peaceful
Penetration, quickening beats in this great life. If we can get these
white men and women to stick to their out-posts, we&rsquo;ll win, in a
few years. But to give up life completely, and sit alone in the night
among the palms in a desolate bit of jungle with one&rsquo;s soul
roving out over the world and the stars in terrible longing&mdash;that
is asking blood tribute, as I know only too well!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And does it seem to you that it will
count?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It will count inconceivably in that biggest of
struggles&mdash;the powers of light against the powers of
darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But right now?&rdquo; Julie queried.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting the East from this
foothold&mdash;and the East, as you will come to know, is too big, too
monstrous a fact to have against our cosmos. We think the moment has
come when, by making clear our ideals here, we can recast her at
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the girl slowly,
&ldquo;&mdash;and atoms count. Why,&rdquo; she broke off, &ldquo;does
one feel the shadows so here, quite cold shadows and pitiless? Mrs.
Calixter seemed to make me feel that it was all a vast tract of
quicksands which finally at some point, would grip one&rsquo;s
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A society like this seems to offer no place to a
young girl. You,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;belong to my Neighbor&rsquo;s
Country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And thus out of this great big life pattern, this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>tremendous human arabesque, he thrust her into the
limbo of the inconjecturable&mdash;out of the work in which he, with
his quick vivid face, looking oddly white and visionary in the
moonlight, had a star part! Standing there among the shadows of the
universe, with the work of men&rsquo;s souls lifted out of her
participation, her heart dropped.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I came,&rdquo; she said, trying to assert some
title to this New World, &ldquo;because I wanted to give a little of my
life&mdash;before I should grow old and forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She looked up and found him staring at her with a
strange intensity. He appeared as startled as if she had just walked
into his soul, a visitant from the Neighbor&rsquo;s Country he had
talked about. Julie was leaning against the wall, and for an instant
they deeply regarded each other. It seemed to the girl that some
powerful experience was seizing possession of her&mdash;as if a flash
of lightning illuminated her being&mdash;deeper than she had ever
dreamed. Just for a second she felt, on unimaginable heights, a moment
of mystery and wonder and high enchantment.</p>
<p class="par">Some one stepped out upon the gallery and the spell that
had caught at the stars broke. The girl quiveringly came back to her
surroundings, wondering what invisible places she had touched.</p>
<p class="par">She heard her companion&rsquo;s voice saying hurriedly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m called away&mdash;in the midst of everything&mdash;on
account of an outbreak of cholera in one of the remote provinces. But I
shall be back in a few days, and I will see you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her ear caught the definite promise and expectation the
words contained, the intimation that their lives had crossed by a
stroke of fate.</p>
<p class="par">That night while she undressed with the light burning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>low, she reviewed in her mind this first day in
the East. She felt as if, from a high seat in some fantastic houdah,
she had seen pass a great pageant. Incredibly exciting and splendidly
adventurous it all was! Compared to the wall-paper universe of her
youth this phenomenal flash of events was unbelievable. To live in a
land where things actually happened, where the hours were full, and
where with every breath one drew in a bewitching experience!
Youth&rsquo;s playground with its everlasting drama impending.</p>
<p class="par">Julie leaned out into the scented darkness and looked
around the sky&mdash;a nightly custom of hers&mdash;a leave taking of
God&rsquo;s world. But this imminent heaven with its fearful host
frightened her. Nothing was familiar. Strange constellations had
pre&euml;mpted the place of the old ones. This was not God&rsquo;s
world, but a world of many gods, and she wondered, with a little
shiver, which one she should propitiate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next morning Mrs. Calixter offered to drive
Julie down to the Ayuntamiento Building where she was to receive her
instructions from the Head of the Department of Education. When Julie
came downstairs, she found Father Hull sitting in the carriage,
opposite Mrs. Calixter, who had promised him a lift to the Observatory.
He greeted Julie with pleasure, and told her that he was on his way to
see Father Algus, who was perfecting a remarkable instrument for
forecasting the typhoons which periodically tore up the islands in
these hazardous seas.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Its success now seems certain,&rdquo; continued
the priest, &ldquo;thanks to Barry McChord, who has been keenly
interested in the invention and has sent to Europe for many delicate
appliances to assist the researches of my venerable friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has so many things to be interested in,&rdquo;
Julie commented with sudden wistfulness.</p>
<p class="par">The priest looked across at her: &ldquo;I think I should
say he has the interest for so many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it because I am a newcomer,&rdquo; the girl
asked the priest, &ldquo;that things seem to move so bewilderingly fast
here&mdash;like a dance whose rhythm you can never catch up
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These, my child,&rdquo; the priest replied,
&ldquo;are the Days of the Empire. Those of us who have experienced
them will remember them always. Conquest and prowess of arms have put a
dangerous fire in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>men&rsquo;s veins. We are reaching out for
more than human hands were meant to grasp. When men are rich overnight,
and women are scarce as queens, the universe is not stable. Not but
that there are some who walk steadily in this fever&mdash;&rdquo; He
smiled at Mrs. Calixter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t count, I&rsquo;m old,&rdquo;
replied that lady.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you challenging youth? Who in my camp fire
colony, as I call it, is so safe and sane as my friend Barry? We have
worked alongside each other for a long time&mdash;and it would be
difficult for me to tell what he has been to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The natives call Barry <i>El Mayor</i>,&rdquo;
Mrs. Calixter told Julie, &ldquo;and believe that in power he is
infinitely above the Governor-General. In so many incorrigible centers
of rebellion he has somehow found an effectual compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The natives reason that governor-generals may
come and go&mdash;and temporary officials of all sorts; but that Barry
is with them for good,&rdquo; Father Hull said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand all his aims. Perhaps they are too wide for me, who find my
own are more than I can hope to cope with&mdash;but what I am very sure
of is that he is working always for a better order of things in the
world. I, too, am selfishly concerned that he should not go away from
here&rdquo;&mdash;the priest laughed; &ldquo;I have planned that he and
I shall grow old here together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And what will the ladies who admire him so much
say to that?&rdquo; Mrs. Calixter demanded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are plenty of others for them. If Barry
were pinned to one little circle how could he wander off to all the
places he&rsquo;s sent to at a moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;like China,
and India and Annam? If there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>mumps in his circle, how could
he attend to cholera in the larger circles?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to let you have him, I
guess,&rdquo; Mrs. Calixter amusedly remarked. She glanced at
Julie&rsquo;s thoughtful face. &ldquo;This young person is on her way
this minute to her fate, and I don&rsquo;t in the least like it that a
certain red-haired person has the settling of it. Maxwell and George
have had a difference&mdash;so we can&rsquo;t lift a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The priest thought for a moment. &ldquo;I should be only
too glad to do anything I could. I know Mr. Maxwell&mdash;but whether
any word of mine would count with him, I can&rsquo;t say. At least I
can make the effort. If you can wait a few moments I will go into
Father Algus&rsquo;s office, and write Mr. Maxwell a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When they had stopped in front of the Observatory,
Father Hull bade them good-morning, begging leave to send out the note
on the plea of his many pressing engagements.</p>
<p class="par">After he had gone, Mrs. Calixter remarked with anxiety,
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look well. He&rsquo;s been told again and again
to take a trip home. He used to be very strong, but he has gone through
many ordeals and borne the brunt of fearful hardship in this new place.
His soul has never wearied; it&rsquo;s on fire like all the others, but
his body is showing the strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She added: &ldquo;While we were waiting for you to come
out, he told me of your meeting of yesterday, and he said that he
thought you were too young to follow the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie waited in an outer room while the chief of
education interviewed personally a long stream of predecessors. These
faces showed a great deal of earnest purpose&mdash;the fervor of the
empire builders, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>Julie had begun to recognize; and yet these
people were not to remain in Manila, but were to go out to the most
distant, unsettled parts of the Islands, to put into execution one of
the most stupendous designs ever launched by any government&mdash;to
put a whole race simultaneously to school.</p>
<p class="par">Julie listened to the reports these people gave of
themselves, and of the wild unheard-of places they were accepting as
their assignments, and knew that the small salaries could not be the
impetus that was sending them, grave but uncomplaining, into far
jungles. <span class="corr" id="xd21e718" title="Source: Or">Of</span>
course they yearned to remain in Manila. They had heard strange tales
of the provinces, and knew that more than one of the number trudging
their missionary way had been murdered; but they had cast in their lot
with the colony, and it was all in the day&rsquo;s work. A strange,
intangible spell had caught their souls, and it seemed that the fervor
of it must set things aflame.</p>
<p class="par">When Julie&rsquo;s turn came, she found herself
confronting an astonishingly tall man with a huge florid head. The
education of several millions of beings was the present concern of that
head, which gave evidence of the magnitude of the problems confronting
it. In times such as these, men are often shot suddenly from
commonplace experience into the most enormous undertakings. In this
case the call appeared to have been too quick. The man was arrogant in
his power, but flustered over his responsibility. All day he had been
dealing with a complexity of human desires, which in almost every
instance had conflicted with his own. Julie stepped into the moment of
greatest tension.</p>
<p class="par">There was a great map on the wall, a scroll of fate to
which the Superintendent referred in making his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>assignments. There is nothing alluring in a map
ever, but this one seemed particularly bleak and strange. The
Superintendent frowned at it. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided yet, Miss
Dreschell, just where I&rsquo;ll send you,&rdquo; he observed in an
olympian manner.</p>
<p class="par">He juggled awhile with the fates, while Julie,
considerably heartened, decided to take advantage of this critical
uncertainty to assist him to a favorable decision.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should very much like Manila,&rdquo; she said
pleasantly.</p>
<p class="par">The Superintendent&rsquo;s negative mental state
vanished electrically. &ldquo;Every person who has entered this room
to-day has said that same thing! You should have come here prepared to
go where you are sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie flushed. &ldquo;The provinces are still in a state
of insurrection,&rdquo; she declared spiritedly. &ldquo;People are
being killed there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Civilians are not,&rdquo; the Superintendent
exclaimed exasperatedly. &ldquo;We are sending teachers out to the most
remote parts, where there are no troops at all, Miss Dreschell. You
will go where I send you, as it is your business to do; and your
station,&rdquo; turning to the dreadful map, &ldquo;will be the small
island known as Nahal, in the southern group.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He irately pointed it out, remote, isolated, the last
before the Pagan group. Julie stared at the outline, and her heart grew
faint. It was the end of the world!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall be going farther South than any one
else,&rdquo; she remarked with a break in her voice. Suddenly she put
her hand in her bag and drew out the letter which she handed to
him.</p>
<p class="par">She watched him read it in curious wonder at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>change that came over her face. &ldquo;This puts a
different light on the matter,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;There is
no favor that Father Hull could ask in the Philippines that would not
be granted at once. I shall endeavor to assign you to the Ermita
district in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">What, Julie wondered, was the strange power of Father
Hull whose words could in an instant revolutionize her fate? Her
visionary green eyes fixed speculatively on that spot on the map.
&ldquo;Father Hull said I was to give you the letter,&rdquo; she said
slowly, &ldquo;but I think if you don&rsquo;t mind, I will go where you
assigned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Superintendent was uncomfortable. There were other
islands much nearer than Nahal to which he might have sent her. He slid
an elastic band over a bunch of papers with an irritated snap.
&ldquo;Do as you like, Miss Dreschell&mdash;but there is Solano&rdquo;;
he pointed suggestively to a larger island farther north than Nahal.
&ldquo;Conditions are better there, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think I will go where I was assigned,&rdquo;
Julie reiterated&mdash;which decision seemed considerably further to
irritate the florid head. It was clear that he was keenly eager to
serve the writer of the letter.</p>
<p class="par">But Julie rose with an air of finality. He stared at her
with annoyance; and when she did not alter her mind, he leaned over his
desk and jotted down a note. Julie knew somehow that it referred to
her. She caught a glimpse of the word Solano, and wondered if he
intended forcing her to go there. Evidently he did not, for as she
stepped through the door, he apologized perfunctorily for the
difficulties of the occasion, and bowed her out with great courtesy.
But Julie, looking up into his face, saw that he would never forget
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>the person who had challenged his power and caused
him to be ashamed of himself. Some time this incident would unfailingly
bear fruit.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Calixter was aghast. &ldquo;He has banished you
into exile!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Could it be because he and
George are at swords&rsquo; points? Did you give him Father
Hull&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I gave it to him, and he took everything back in
a wink, and offered me Manila; but while I sat there looking at my
mysterious island, I recalled the faces of some of those teachers, and
the face of&mdash;a person I met last night, and I asked myself why I
should shirk just exactly that which I had come over to do. Why,&rdquo;
she added suddenly, &ldquo;did Father Hull&rsquo;s letter make such an
impression? The Church over here must be very powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Church hasn&rsquo;t a thing to do with it.
It&rsquo;s the man! He&rsquo;s a saint, and the spiritual custodian of
the colony. He came over here as the Chaplain of the Twenty-fourth, and
marched right alongside the men into every danger. There wasn&rsquo;t a
soldier in the regiment that wouldn&rsquo;t have gone straight through
Hell at his word. Yet I imagine he found it harder to make them go the
other way. He is known everywhere, and by everybody. No one could deny
him anything&mdash;it&rsquo;s the power of one man&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There seem to be so many over here like
that!&rdquo; Before Julie&rsquo;s half-closed eyes a stream of faces
rose. One pre&euml;minently stood out, illuminated by moonlight, and
fired with the undying fervor of purpose. It was her sub-conscious
being which, stirred by the intimations received last night on the
roof, had decided in a flash for her in the Superintendent&rsquo;s
office.</p>
<p class="par">With the vision still about her and before her, she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>arrived at the home of Isabel Armistead, the woman
of Asian mystery.</p>
<p class="par">The dwarf that she had seen before in the garden
received her. She had thought that he looked like a child, but she saw
now that the queer little creature was of a man&rsquo;s years. She
could not resist speaking to him, and the mannikin smiled at her out of
his saddened, puckered little face. He showed her upstairs into a
<i>sala</i> so vast that it seemed literally a sweep of space broken by
transcendently carved pillars.</p>
<p class="par">The house was more than a century old, and had come down
to Isabel through her inconjectural native connections. Its carvings
belonged to an era of Pharaonic hordes of labor, or slavery. The house
and the other vast properties of its owner had somehow come down
unmolested by official upheavals.</p>
<p class="par">The family was a queer one of many strains; all the East
was in its veins. After her husband and her daughter had departed for
England, Isabel&rsquo;s mother, it was said, had gone up into a holy
mountain to practice witchcraft. At any rate, after a time, she had
disappeared, never, apparently, to be heard of again. The influence of
this strange mother, Mrs. Calixter had told Julie, was still
perpetuated. One native lady of her acquaintance had shown Mrs.
Calixter one of the old witch-mother&rsquo;s <i>anting-antings</i>,
proclaiming that she always wore it, and that it had astoundingly
protected all her life, shielding her and her family from all evil and
lifting them above the common lot of men.</p>
<p class="par">Julie thought of these strange rumors as she looked
about her. The walls were hung with a great many rich embroideries,
brilliant silks blooming with the unfamiliar flowers of far kingdoms.
It was like walking in a garden of Cathay. The room appeared to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>Julie like a chamber of an Eastern palace in a
rich pagodaed city: there was furniture of teak-wood black as a Nubian,
brought from distant jungles by toiling elephants, all marvelously
carved into scaled monsters; there were ivory gods with sleeping faces;
curtains strewn with gold, hanging in dim recesses; rugs&mdash;that
generations of men in almost mythical retreats of the Himalayas had
been a century or two in weaving&mdash;lying like islands on the
shining dark lacquered floor, in which the shadows of the passer-by
drowned to endless depths; a pair of sentinel vases higher than a
man&mdash;made a thousand years ago for an emperor who had become a
god&mdash;out of their tops a thin ribbon of green smoke curling from
hidden incense; and in one corner, hung with flowers, a queer altar to
whatever gods Isabel believed in.</p>
<p class="par">Toward this niche Julie bent curious footsteps. The
altar was in the shape of a temple, a gilded fantastic thing, wrought
in what country it would have been impossible to say. A Green God, like
the monstrous genie of a lake, sat cross-legged in the nave of the
shrine staring at rows of grotesque faces carved in the walls. The
artist had exercised the art of a Leonardo da Vinci; in the face of the
little idol there was neither the dead marooned calm of the great
Diabutz nor the cruel evil of Mongolian gods. He was just a quiet
little deity, green as the far spaces of the skies, sitting thinking in
his temple; but there was in his oblivious, impersonal reflection
something that clutched at the heart.</p>
<p class="par">Julie glanced up depressed, to find Isabel regarding
her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a terrible god!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl
with a shiver. &ldquo;Is he yours?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Isabel smiled. &ldquo;He is the god who is &lsquo;on the
job,&rsquo; as you Americans say it. The Great One is too great, the
philosophers tell us, to have anything to do with us. He has abstract
names, and is too isolated by infinity to be prayed to. But this little
god, he knows, he knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Has he a name?&rdquo; asked Julie, much puzzled
by this blatant paganism. The Islands were undoubtedly a very strange
place.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In different lands, we call him different
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie turned from the niche, &ldquo;I am going to the
island of Nahal,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I have come to see what
you can tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel&rsquo;s blue eyes widened. &ldquo;It is far, very
far! We shall never hear of you again. It takes weeks to reach there,
because no boats run regularly. You can get to Solano in three or four
days, if you are lucky enough to catch a boat&mdash;from there once in
a while a boat goes down to Nahal. It is a small island; the people are
Visayans. I really do not know so much about it, you see. It is
turbulent, I believe. Is there a military garrison?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie was not sure. A volunteer force had recently been
withdrawn from it; Mr. Calixter was trying to discover whether other
troops had replaced the volunteers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Most of the women have been ordered out of those
dangerous places in the South. Have you not heard the things that have
been done there? You are foolhardy to have come&mdash;some strange
madness possesses you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s eyes took on an abstracted look. &ldquo;It
is a madness that possesses others, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have not seen it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie looked at her but remained silent. The two
regarded each other; Isabel out of her blue eyes, Julie out of her
jade-green ones.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why do you go? It is not safe. There are places
in these islands where white women have never been seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s eyes awoke. &ldquo;I shall have something
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Will you stay in the wilds till you have given
the Nahal islanders the higher education? Bah! Why do you wish to waste
your youth at such things? You are beautiful, and were made to be
admired, not to bury your youth in forgotten islands. You were made to
taste life a little richer in the fruit than the rest. And you who
could win so much renounce it all to be a spectacled ascetic hanging to
the tails of existence. No Spanish woman would dream of doing such a
thing! You have come half way round the world to do some vague thing
you&rsquo;ve set your heart on. Set your heart on life&mdash;it owes
you much; make it magnificently pay! Did my Green God give you those
eyes and that face for the edification of small Malays? Stay in Manila
and drink life here where it sparkles and overflows the goblet. I would
no more do what you are doing! I might be a nun&mdash;that is
picturesque and fiercely renunciative. But to be a pedagogue to brown
savages!&mdash;it is dull to tears. Then,&rdquo;&mdash;as a final
overpowering fact&mdash;&ldquo;there will be no men!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s eyes gleamed disapprobation. &ldquo;The
women of America have many resources. They go along their real way
until their real fate overtakes them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A single fate! Is there such a thing?&rdquo;
Isabel seemed feverishly to question herself. &ldquo;I have made a long
quest. I ought to know. No, there is no such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>thing.
It is a tradition they fasten in women&rsquo;s minds, to make them
become mothers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she continued, turning toward the
temple, &ldquo;I will give you a present, because I am so sorry for you
with such a terrible future. You are going out to be a little
Atlas&mdash;to lift up the world. Tell me, when you return, how much
you have supported on your little back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For an instant Julie was afraid that Isabel was going to
present her with the Green God, but she reached within the shrine and
drew out, not the God&mdash;to Julie&rsquo;s unspeakable
relief&mdash;but an exquisite circle of jade, clear and green like a
tropical lake.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A jewel from the Green God for you who have his
stamp in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie started. &ldquo;Some one else told me
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry McChord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel&rsquo;s lids dropped over her blue eyes.
&ldquo;You know him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I met him last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And he noticed your eyes&mdash;that
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But nobody will notice them now&mdash;&rdquo; It
was absurd to assume that there was the faintest flicker of
satisfaction in the other woman&rsquo;s look, Julie thought.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel slipped the bracelet over Julie&rsquo;s wrist.
&ldquo;It has belonged to many women in many ages. Perhaps you will
make more history for it. What beautiful bones you have!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;They are like sculpture&mdash;even in your cheeks
where the bones of the English go wrong. And your flesh is flawless; an
angel might use it to come down to earth. Look at the
difference.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She drew Julie&rsquo;s arm up beside her own to the
light. &ldquo;Yours is snowy, way down to the depths; but the light
stops under my skin, it can&rsquo;t get down. That is the difference
between you and me!&rdquo; She loosed Julie abruptly. &ldquo;Ah,
well&mdash;you are blind. Go hold up the world, and break your poor
little back, when you might be ruling the world, like me. All the East,
you know, is mine to work my will in.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Because Isabel was of that East, which she so
fantastically claimed, Julie took lightly all she said. To boast of
swaying empires and of taking kings out of their thrones was part of
the inalienable imagery of the East, as were the widely unreal, the
impossibly beautiful things in the old Chinese lyrics. Isabel implied
that Julie had only to step out of her insignificant profession to find
herself ruling the world, the world of to-day, which had such a
marvelous capacity for ruling itself. It was strange how something at
other moments so exalted could, under this woman&rsquo;s manipulation,
become all at once so obscure. Julie, turning to depart, thanked Isabel
for the bracelet.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Remember, I am your friend,&rdquo; Isabel said,
&ldquo;and I will help you at any time you say so. <i lang=
"es">Adios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie left her standing in the center of her magic
chamber, its splendor hovering about her, her dark face merging into
its richness like that of some forgotten goddess.</p>
<p class="par">With his small powerful arms, the dwarf swung the gate
open for her. She looked back at the garden starred with strange
flowers, at the tiers of steps and bright pillars which made the house
resemble a Babylonian palace, at the light of the stained glass under
the blaze of sunlight: in that bizarre house had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>lived a
woman who had gone out to the tops of mountains searching for
spells!</p>
<p class="par">In those moments when Julie cogitated upon matters of
human life in connection with the Deity, she conceived Him rather
vaguely as a sort of sublime executive, who drew up&mdash;sometimes
perforce a little hurriedly perhaps&mdash;plans of eternal destiny for
everybody. Dealing liberally in catastrophe, disease, old age, poverty,
and death, He yet conceded, like allowances of candy to children, a
certain amount of impermanent happiness; and it was into this
arrangement of things that the race was privileged to enter.</p>
<p class="par">She wondered, as she turned from Isabel&rsquo;s gate,
who the little Green God was; and whether he had any character by which
he would be recognized in the West. She who had started out with a
nameless exalted fervor, whose spirit had been skimming like an
inspired comet through space, had been suddenly halted before a strange
house in which she had encountered disquieting things&mdash;things
which had brought the comet down to a scented and blooming earth. So do
the moods of youth sway in the last wind blowing.</p>
<p class="par">Still nothing caused Julie to change her intentions; not
the troubled counsel of Father Hull, given in his tired voice; nor the
Calixters&rsquo; tales of the far, fearful South; nor the exotic
arguments listened to in the Babylonian house. She set sail for the
South on the day that had been set. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie sat restively on the blistering deck of a
small vessel in the harbor of Solano. The <i>Black Pearl</i>, which had
brought her from Manila, had deposited her in this blazing
city&mdash;which now lay before her like a peeling off the
sun&mdash;and had sailed on in the trail of the East Indies. She had
been forced to wait an incredible time for the rare chance that would
send a boat from Solano to her own world-forgotten island. Even now she
would not have been on her way, if a government official had not
appeared from Manila and, from Solano, demanded transportation
forthwith to Nahal.</p>
<p class="par">It was getting late&mdash;late for a day when everybody
rises at dawn, when at last there walked across the gang-plank a young
man in a Norfolk khaki suit and a white helmet. He was followed by a
procession of natives carrying his luggage, which they had so
<span class="corr" id="xd21e884" title="Source: light">lightly</span>
distributed among themselves that it took some time for the column to
transfer itself from land to sea. It took more time, and a knowledge of
the coin of the land&mdash;which knowledge the young man seemed to
have&mdash;to compensate these individuals, who raised a protest over
the glittering new centavos. The young man was obliged to add to his
payment, whereupon the recipients protested more loudly than ever, and
would not subside. The captain in disgust contemptuously ordered the
gang-plank lifted with them still on it. Life in the East was too
prolific anyway.</p>
<p class="par">The young man, who had such a dark skin that Julie
concluded that he must be a Spaniard, came forward <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>with his
luggage, which he now conveyed himself, replacing a dozen natives.</p>
<p class="par">When he perceived Julie, he seemed much taken aback, and
removed his helmet, revealing a young assured face, a trifle heavy, and
a pair of very light blue eyes. Julie looked at him attentively.</p>
<p class="par">He paused, holding his helmet in his hand. It was dear
that he wanted to speak. He had the same curious, almost incredulous
expression of those armies of men in Manila.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, overcome by
his desire to address her; &ldquo;I had no idea I was keeping any one
waiting. I understood that I was the only passenger for Nahal.&rdquo;
All the time he was speaking his eyes never swerved from her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; Julie replied,
&ldquo;except for the heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The young man sat down not very far away from her, on a
chair which he had brought.</p>
<p class="par">Julie leaned over the railing and watched the recession
of Solano. Somewhere far off in the sea was her own terrible little
island about which she wondered deeply; she remembered now acutely that
she need not have gone to that Robinson Crusoe fastness. Father Hull
had warned her, and so had every one else. Suddenly an image rose
before her, a great youthful frame with a rumpled head. For a moment
she seemed to be facing its high and inflexible resolve.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We are surely bound for No Man&rsquo;s
Land!&rdquo; The young man at her side was addressing her.</p>
<p class="par">She nodded gravely.</p>
<p class="par">The young man went on politely to say that a Spanish
Mestizo general was making himself troublesome on the island of Nahal.
He was a great bother to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>Government, which was trying to bring
strife to an end in order to set up its great emancipation schemes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They are over-sentimentalizing the
thing&mdash;think the bird can be caught by putting salt on his tail.
Government wants everybody to lay down arms and listen to the gospel of
democracy. Fancy that in the East!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It must be a fearful struggle when the people are
so unconvinced. There were guns going off all night in Solano!&rdquo;
Julie reflected. &ldquo;Are there any men and women on
Nahal?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! of course.&rdquo; The young man made a
carelessly expansive gesture. &ldquo;There are natives
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I mean real people, white people, people that
make things happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hope so. The natives are no good except for
background; help along with palms and things to fill up
space.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thereupon the young man introduced himself, and
commenced to explain to Julie that he was going to the island to act as
Treasurer. He had been a captain of volunteers, and appeared to
deprecate his present office. It served in his opinion, however, as a
step to higher things. A Filipino had been made governor of
Nahal&mdash;matter of government policy; but as he didn&rsquo;t count
for much, Mr. Purcell&mdash;such was the name the young man gave
himself&mdash;had been sent down to bolster things up. His father was a
politician in Iowa, and would look out for his son&rsquo;s advancement.
His parents did not approve his roving, oriental life, and wanted him
to come home and settle down. He allowed a considerable pause to ensue
after this reflection. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">For hours the only two persons on the tiny deck, they
sat and watched the sea. Later in the afternoon, the sky grew overcast,
bringing relief from the intolerable heat.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, a dissolving cloud broke apart on the horizon,
and the sun lit up an island green and wild as a new-made world. Julie
rose with a cry at the beauty of it. That was Nahal! Mars itself could
not have looked more uninhabited. What subliminal, lonely wildness! It
called up to her the vision of the wild, moon-swept cliffs of Mindoro,
passed at night on the way down to Solano, with its mysterious jungle
and without even a light against its primal shores. This little island
had ridges of green cones, that looked in the distance like the domes
and spires of mosques, all clothed in quiet forests over which the wind
seemed scarcely to blow.</p>
<p class="par">The vessel was making for the eastern coast, to a town
called Dao, where it was to drop mail. It would then continue to
Guindulman, whither both passengers were bound.</p>
<p class="par">At Dao, the Captain said the passengers might go ashore;
so Julie and Mr. Purcell went with him in a leaky row-boat into a cove
of the harbor, which was bounded on both sides by long gleaming arms of
beach dotted with palm trees, their heads bent like pensive
thinkers.</p>
<p class="par">A small village barely peeped out from under the foliage
of the great tropical trees. A dusty primitive road ran down from the
village to the rude pier. They climbed up to it by means of a flight of
slippery green stairs, a heroic undertaking for Julie in her white
clothes.</p>
<p class="par">To her it appeared at once as an island of appalling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>silence. Even the sea out there was not so still.
A primitive, all-pervading hush&mdash;the deepest she had ever known. A
queer sensation came over her of having reached a point in the universe
where time was not.</p>
<p class="par">A crowd of natives had commenced quietly to gather. Two
white men were approaching; one a young officer in a khaki uniform,
with a sword hooked to his belt; the other nondescriptly appareled in
an officer&rsquo;s blouse devoid of insignia, a pair of bleached
trousers that came considerably above his shoe tops, and a peaked straw
hat.</p>
<p class="par">As they drew near, these men looked at Julie in
amazement. The Captain presented the officer as Lieutenant Adams. Julie
noticed at once the deep shadow that rested upon his thin, troubled
face. The other strange-looking gentleman was the Doctor. Outside of
these two, the Captain remarked, there was only one white person on
this side of the island. At this allusion, Julie noticed strained
glances exchanged.</p>
<p class="par">When Purcell got the chance, he whispered to Julie that
this third person was the captain in command&mdash;perpetually drunk,
and frequently insane with delirium tremens. He had been a fearless
soldier, and had once performed a hazardous mission for the Government;
and he had been put off here, with a one-company command, in the idea
that he could do little harm. But this drink-maddened czar in his times
of dementia maintained a reign of terror over his small domain that
brought it always to the verge of mutiny. Only one thing stood between
his brutality and disaster. This was young Adams, who interposed
between the captain and his men&mdash;and who spent weeks in arrest or
confinement for his pains.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What lives you regulars lead!&rdquo; Purcell
exclaimed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>to the Doctor. &ldquo;Do you think any volunteer
organization would stand for that whiskey king? They&rsquo;d take him
out and twist his head off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Adams frowned. &ldquo;Let go, before the natives, when
the whole blooming show is at stake over here? We&rsquo;re not just a
company of infantry. We&rsquo;re the Army! I&rsquo;d have my own head
twisted off first.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it were not for Adams,&rdquo; the Doctor said,
shaking his head, &ldquo;there&rsquo;d be a holocaust, all right. It
frequently occurs to me to take to the open sea. But I&rsquo;d like
Adams to go with me, and he keeps Nero so peeved by his altruism that
the old monster locks him up; so he can&rsquo;t get away. Miss
Dreschell,&rdquo; he continued, turning engagingly to her in his
quaintly deranged hat and incoherent costume, &ldquo;you must really
pardon my clothes. As you may not have found it difficult to surmise, I
haven&rsquo;t any. I came here a thousand years ago, and never expected
to encounter a lady again. I have written to a tailor regularly,
enclosing at various times a roll of bills&mdash;impossible to send
money orders, there being no post-office on this island; but that evil
one simply disdains to reply. All the world, by some singular sort of
erosion, seems to have receded from us. I shall eventually be reduced
to fig leaves&mdash;though they are not indigenous to the island, and
banana leaves, while dressy and expansive, will not bear needle and
thread, nor glue together with any success.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said to her in a lower tone,
&ldquo;that you will talk very nicely to Adams. There is no such thing
as speech left in our principality, nor mirth except the laughter of
the monkeys in the hills. Our brains are sucked out; never a new idea
comes here&mdash;save what that black son of Neptune purveys every
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>two months. Give the lad something to think about
in the next cycle of years. And I am asking you privately not to regard
me too closely when we ascend the hill. You happened upon me just
before my monthly sewing day. There goes our mail.&rdquo; He pointed to
a loaded sack that a soldier was carrying up the hill. &ldquo;It
reminds me that there is one thing you don&rsquo;t have to worry about
here&mdash;that&rsquo;s bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Doctor waved his hand ahead of him. &ldquo;Behold,
the population of Nahal is coming down from the hills to look at you.
You are the first white woman to land on this spot. Number this as an
indelible day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie was staring with all her eyes. Whereas a handful
of people had stood but a short time ago about the wharf, the road and
the surrounding vicinity were now black with natives surging in her
direction. They formed a solid staring girdle around her, their
unblinking eyes riveted upon her.</p>
<p class="par">To them her blond fairness was miraculous. When the
Doctor made her take off her hat, and her singular silvery blond hair
came forth to view, lighting her dazzling skin, a deep quiet stir went
through the crowd. The girl stood abashed in the midst of it. Long,
long afterwards, when many others had paid tribute to her beauty, Julie
remembered that moment in a wild little spot out of the world.</p>
<p class="par">One grimy little child crept up towards her, and,
plucking at her garments, demanded if she were not the Blessed Virgin.
The men of the lonely lives turned abruptly. The others followed after
them up the hill, Julie&rsquo;s native coterie trailing behind her.
They picked flowers for her, and offered her strange sweets.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A queen for a day!&rdquo; she laughed to
Lieutenant Adams, who was walking beside her. &ldquo;I shall remember
Dao until the end of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the strange part of the natives;
they admire our type more than their own. You are absolute beauty to
them&mdash;very near a glimpse of God. I am going to send your
worshipers away now, and ask you to take a walk with me; for you will
be here only a couple of hours&mdash;two hours out of eternity, and I
must talk! It is a long time since I said anything real. Let us waive
the world, and consider that we are two people met in outer space at
the end of time, and that it does not matter at all what we say.&rdquo;
He looked up quickly into her wondering face. &ldquo;You think
I&rsquo;m mad. What else, in heaven&rsquo;s name could I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She regarded the strained, urgent face, and felt a
subtle appeal being made to her&mdash;youth in hard straits, to
youth.</p>
<p class="par">They strolled down the main thoroughfare of the town.
Knitted closely together with foliage, it presented a weird aspect.
Adams explained that the Commandant liked this wild growth. They
stepped into a side street, and he indicated with a grimly significant
nod one house larger than the rest. Adams passed it quickly; but before
turning down the lane, Julie glanced back and beheld a great shape at
the window, bloated and distorted, the hair standing out all over its
head. The man creature up there was in the depth of one of his worst
debauches, when for a week he did not touch food but lived in an
alcoholic frenzy. He was scarcely human, and Julie, who had never
dreamed of the existence of such a thing, fled down the street with a
smothered cry. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Adams demanded.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He was at the window. Oh! how awful! How can you
live here?&rdquo; A deep shame mantled the young man&rsquo;s grimness.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a beast?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie followed her guide up the hill, reflecting that
strange lives must be expected to make strange men. Adams pointed out a
flat stone for a seat, and, drawing a long breath, dropped down upon
another.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; he began;
&ldquo;and where do you think you are going? That&rsquo;s what we
always want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie explained the uncertainty she faced. He looked at
her keenly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I used to be in Guindulman,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the three garrisons on the island, including
this place and Tarlac&mdash;only a battalion altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She returned to him his question&mdash;the genesis of
everything in the East. &ldquo;And you&mdash;how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Year and a half.
I&rsquo;ve lost all track of time.&rdquo; He pointed to some pensively
quiescent hills. &ldquo;Could you fasten time, or change to them? As it
was in the beginning, so it shall ever be, world without end. You get
up in the morning and go to bed at night, till your brain reels. I hate
this eternity. I want to live or I want to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why do they leave you? It&rsquo;s
wicked!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why do they send a mere child like you to Nahal?
We&rsquo;re grist for the mill. In order that big things shall come
forth from it, the wheels must grind exceeding fine. You and I are
slated for powder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is my private little hell. I&rsquo;ve got to
keep the old man from running amuck and the men from breaking out. But
what I want to tell you right now&mdash;because we are going to be such
awfully good friends&mdash;is that I am sick of my job, and I&rsquo;m
afraid that I&rsquo;m <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>going to break out too. I&rsquo;ve lost my
perspective. They might have let me go out for just a little while. All
the time, I&rsquo;m in insurrection inside. I seem to have slipped some
vital moorings&mdash;and to be adrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t yield now, after
struggling so long?&rdquo; Julie pleaded. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so sorry
for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He clutched his face in his hands, and looked out
through the foliage across the sea. &ldquo;What is life, anyway? There
must be more of existence than what we manage to find. Sometimes I can
feel whispers of it. Do you think I&rsquo;m mad, or just soul-sick of
my kind of a world? You see I&rsquo;m only a poor devil in purgatory,
trying&mdash;and not succeeding&mdash;to fight my way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have been splendid,&rdquo; she said
tremulously. &ldquo;Does it mean anything to you to know that I think
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He straightened quickly. &ldquo;It means a lot. This
hour has put something into my veins.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly the boat whistled from the harbor. He took her
hand, and said with a feeling which he could ill conceal: &ldquo;The
Blessed Virgin did not visit Purgatory for nothing this day.&rdquo;
Then he added: &ldquo;I shall see you. Perhaps they will let me come to
Guindulman&mdash;Ah, anyway, I shall see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie from the boat waved a farewell to the khaki-clad
figure standing on the pier, Mr. Purcell watching her intently all the
while. &ldquo;Military gentlemen,&rdquo; he informed the universe in a
meditatively resentful way, &ldquo;are always irresistible to
women.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In darkness, rain, and perturbation, Julie landed
at her destination. A storm had blown up from the Sulu Sea, to which
they were quite close. Before the light had faded, however, the Captain
had pointed out as Guindulman a spot in the long, low stretch of gray
green against the gray sea, where a lonely torch light shot up in the
dusk and was gone. Julie&rsquo;s companion had managed to make the
latter part of the voyage somewhat too disturbingly intimate, and she
hoped fervently that their ways would soon part.</p>
<p class="par">In a large house near the wharf, they found that a white
woman, a teacher, was quartered. She sent word that she would look out
for Julie. Mr. Purcell was directed to the Officers&rsquo; Mess.</p>
<p class="par">Miss Hope, a succinct person with the ineradicable stamp
of pedagogical command upon her, greeted Julie, and explained
conditions while the girl changed her drenched clothing. Of the two
available intra-suelo rooms rented from the prosperous native family
above, one could be turned over to Julie&mdash;the one, the girl noted,
that was closest to the malaria-soaked ground. Because of the military
occupation, the village was badly crowded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The General Superintendent must have known
something about this place,&rdquo; Julie reflected; &ldquo;since he
sent you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, I know him very well,&rdquo; Miss Hope
declared. &ldquo;He is a very busy man, and cannot be expected to know
everything. This is the world&rsquo;s end&mdash;but I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>came
here on my own request. I have a project which obliges me to teach in
at least one remote island. My plan is to teach in every country around
the world, as far as I can get. In addition to teaching in the States,
I have already put in one term in Honolulu, one in Yokohama, another in
a girls&rsquo; school in Pekin. From here, I project India and Ceylon,
a course of English in a Greek School, ending up in a college in
Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Everybody over here, Julie reminded herself, had a
separate and astonishing thing to do.</p>
<p class="par">The rain had stopped when they set out to climb the hill
to the Mess for dinner. There was one general military mess where most
of the white colony ate, Miss Hope explained.</p>
<p class="par">In the inky blackness Julie could form no impression of
the town. There was the usual plaza inevitable to every Spanish town,
on a plateau at the top of the hill. On a corner of the plaza loomed
the large house of the august Commandant.</p>
<p class="par">Dinner was almost over when they arrived. Here in this
one room, closed against the elements like some Monte Cristo world,
were nearly all the white inhabitants of the place. A hush fell as the
newcomer stepped in among them.</p>
<p class="par">In a community like this everybody was potential. The
girl looked about her, stirred at the encounter with these beings who
were to become the companions of her life; and when she was stirred the
singular, characteristic inner gleam came out and lighted her features.
These people, huddled together to keep their spirits alive in their
neglected corner of the world, woke up as if they had received a
message from their lost existence.</p>
<p class="par">Major Landon, the Commandant, a tall, stern-looking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>man of swarthy complexion, rose and greeted her,
with the greatest possible courtesy, Julie thought. He was in fact kind
to her at once. That this graciousness did not extend to every one, she
soon learned. His deep utterance rolled around in his throat like a
growl, and seldom got completely out. &ldquo;You are the first American
girl to visit Nahal,&rdquo; he rumbled. &ldquo;We hope you&rsquo;ll
stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Miss Hope looked vexed, and resumed her
introductions.</p>
<p class="par">The Smiths were the only married couple. Theirs was a
very recent and spectacular marriage&mdash;any reference to which
seemed excessively to annoy the Major.</p>
<p class="par">The two remaining members of the mess present were
Lieutenants Dwight and Brentwood, members temporarily, since they had
lost their cook; Bentwood, the Major&rsquo;s Adjutant, was a
prosaically good-looking young man who certainly tried his best to
please the Major by purring optimistically at him all the time, only to
get snarled at for his pains.</p>
<p class="par">The very slimmest lady with the very yellowest hair
Julie had ever seen leaned across and whispered encouragingly:
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he an ogre! I came here, a bride, six months ago,
and he frightened me to death. I had come seven thousand miles to marry
dear Marlborough&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t seen him since he was thirteen
years old&mdash;and you can imagine!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Luella,&rdquo; Mr. Smith called from the
door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Some time I&rsquo;ll tell you what the monster
said.&rdquo; The slim lady floated off.</p>
<p class="par">Julie gave ear to Mr. Dwight on her left, whose
attention had been so persistently straying from his food to her that
the Major&rsquo;s basilisk eye had frequently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>to
recall it. Dwight explained to Julie in lowered tones&mdash;the Major
was happily a little deaf&mdash;that the Commanding Officer was a
somber old file, of belated rank and defeated hopes. Even his marriage
had been a retarded affair&mdash;the lady had become middle-aged
waiting for him to propose, when suddenly she had discovered that he
had been making declarations to her for fifteen years, which, owing to
his unintelligible utterance, she had never understood. Since the Major
had been so deliberate in his own matrimonial concerns, he regarded
with disfavor the precipitate nuptials of the Smiths.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning when they again climbed the hill, Julie
saw the village of Guindulman for the first time. Always thereafter it
was set apart in her memory as a shining village set upon a bluff above
the sea against an emerald tropical forest. Along its lone lines of
snow-white beach, palms waved in solitude. Over to the east a very
singular natural causeway united the island with a smaller one. To
Julie there was something very aloof and strange about this causeway
with the sea surging up on either side. The whole looked like Eden,
new, green, and expectant.</p>
<p class="par">Nahal was in insurrection. A great proportion of its
native men had decamped for the hills, where under General Andegas they
engaged in outlawry of every sort, seizing the property of peaceful
natives and even killing them on the slightest suspicion that they were
friendly to the Americans.</p>
<p class="par">The Major was an old soldier, and for all his brusquerie
a good one; but after a long sojourn in the subordinate grades he had
lost youth&rsquo;s sublime capacity for hazard. He knew that if he
should employ the measures essential to the pacification of the island,
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>measures requisite for the obliteration of its
chaos and disorder, he would end up as an oblation on the altar of
American conscience. There might be others who could laugh in the teeth
of the gods but the Major was too old. So, high up in his great open
room, he could be seen by his world eternally walking about like a
caged lion. There is no such bitter spectacle as that of a strong man
knowing and yet fearing his own mind.</p>
<p class="par">Around the plaza was all the history Guindulman had ever
had. The church was very old, and was supposed to trace back to the
activities of the Legaspian missionaries. It had a three-storied stone
tower, in which there yawned three gaps for missing bells carried off
by Mohammedan pirates to their own terrible island&mdash;discernible on
clear days as a sinister shadow against the sea. The fa&ccedil;ade of
the church offered an entertaining exposition of the Book of
Revelations. The several different kinds of Horned Beasts roared
sulphurously from its brow, surreptitiously urged on from under the
eaves by the Scarlet Woman; an incensed angel in the center with
militant wings and drawn sword, gave them all battle, while under his
feet a frightened saint hugged the arms of Spain in desperation.</p>
<p class="par">Outside the door of the church stood a slim, black-robed
figure, which, as the two women approached, turned upon them out of a
somber and lonely face the sudden fire of a pair of piercing black
eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good morning, Padre,&rdquo; Miss Hope essayed
deferentially. &ldquo;May I present Miss Dreschell, who has come to
take charge of the Boys&rsquo; School?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A change flashed through the priest&rsquo;s face, which
was not suppressed before Julie had looked into a hidden chamber of his
personality. The priest&mdash;he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>young and had all the
swift movements of youth&mdash;looked at Julie quickly, and murmured a
few Spanish words; then with an inclination of the head, he moved away.
A crowd of children on their way to school came flocking about him.</p>
<p class="par">Miss Hope said that he was a mestizo, the usual warring
half-and-half&mdash;all restless souls vainly seeking, between two
races, their destiny. James, the American teacher, who had visited him
in his <i lang="es">convento</i>, said that Father Herrero knew both
Greek and Latin, which in these parts was the same as saying that the
Sultan of Jolo could speak French.</p>
<p class="par">The Ayuntamiento, or government building, seemed in its
huge concrete size, to overtop the village. It held all the offices of
the government, and streams of people were to be seen hurrying in and
out.</p>
<p class="par">In a wing of the building Julie saw a great upstairs
gallery where two hammocks were hung. These were the quarters, Miss
Hope thought, of the new Treasurer, the gentleman who had brought Julie
ashore. Troops quartered downstairs made this building eminently safe.
In a low-roofed building adjoining, prisoners stuck sociable faces out
between iron bars.</p>
<p class="par">The bachelor officers lived on the corner opposite the
Major, the rest of the colony in intermediate houses. Thus the Major
had his whole domain under his eyes, and could even see when those of
the bachelors who messed separately across the plaza came to the table
in their shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p class="par">As Miss Hope and Julie walked down the road toward the
side street where the two schools were located, the crowd of children
who had been following the Padre detached themselves with the
inevitable inconstancy of childhood, and formed a devoted train
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>around the teachers, offering them flowers. Julie,
who was pretty and always popular with children, fell into possession
of most of these.</p>
<p class="par">The priest, left alone, frowned slightly in her
direction. Before turning back into the church grounds he paused a
moment at the gate, and Julie saw a portentous shadow cross his
face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most powerful man on the
island,&rdquo; Miss Hope remarked. &ldquo;The Padre, for that matter,
always is. He is the mind of these people. Some of the officers accuse
him of all sorts of things. It&rsquo;s hard to tell from his face what
he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boys&rsquo; and the girls&rsquo; schools stood
opposite each other on a long, wide side street, over-shadowed by great
tropical trees, in which the boys roosted out of hours among the
mangoes and bananas. The buildings were high and roomy, overlooking
charming scenery of jungle and sea, and were surrounded by the
overgrown grounds that children love. This street was their retreat;
they lived in it nearly all the time, played their games, mostly now
those imported from America, and satisfied their hungry appetites with
the queer cheap candies and little sponge cakes, made of very ancient
eggs, that were purveyed in its stalls.</p>
<p class="par">Julie turned into the Boys&rsquo; School, now her
responsibility, while Miss Hope crossed the street. Miss Hope, Julie
learned, had several native teachers to help her; whereas one
ex-soldier was the only assistant she had with over a hundred boys.
Brown boys of every age and stature were filing past her up the stairs.
The airy tropical structure rocked to its foundation under the
onsweeping surge of youth. Julie looked out at the golden morning, and
her thoughts glowed. She felt equal to any enterprise in creation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mr. James was a well educated young man, who had come
out to fight for his country; and who had stayed behind like others of
his countrymen to experiment. He was not a regularly certificated
teacher, but he was a good instructor and had been making remarkable
progress with the older boys, with whom Julie could see he yearned to
continue. The younger ones were not advancing, James confessed; his one
ambitious idea having been to turn out candidates for scholarships in
America.</p>
<p class="par">Julie offered to take over the junior classes. Her sixty
<i lang="es">aspirantes</i> filled every nook and corner of the room;
sixty funny little brown creatures, fresh from their morning dip in the
river, sitting like wet little birds in quivering expectancy. Julie
glanced over the rows of brown heads:&mdash;the people that the Caravan
in its long march had left behind. The boys put their heads down on the
desks, like little setters, and stared. One hundred and twenty black
beads peered up at her. She was beginning to be disconcerted, when a
delightful little savage with hair standing up stiffly all over his
head, like a circular brush, detached himself from the brown mass, and,
moved by some aberrant impulse, strayed barefoot up to Julie&rsquo;s
desk and irrelevantly laid upon it a rooster&rsquo;s long, bedraggled
tail feather. Having consummated this act of tribute, Delphine, who was
to become his teacher&rsquo;s undying friend, stole back.</p>
<p class="par">Seized by an idea, Julie drew a picture of the feather
on the board. The class sat up and inspected this feat. Having a knack
with a pencil, she elaborated the feather into a rooster. A murmur of
recognition and pure delight passed through the class. The bird on the
board was a national idol. Unwittingly and quite by chance she had
captured their interest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In a few days they were chanting glibly of the rat and
the cat and the permanently unpleasant relations between the two,
soaking in learning by means of their incredible memories, and
wrestling musically with the dark, mystic bars of the Star Spangled
Banner and the Battle Hymn of the Republic.</p>
<p class="par">James taught mathematics, and almost nothing else. He
had a passion for numbers, which he taught dogmatically as the whole
science of life. His boys had been shot dazedly through fractions, and
were now halting awestruck before the heights of geometry. The fact and
values of the universe astounded their unaccustomed minds. Their island
had been their center of existence, and in this painful trepanning,
their brains gaped before the marvels and terrors of higher human
thought. These incipient philosophers, much perturbed, used to seek
Julie out to ask her to explain a little the metaphysical net in which
they found themselves fast. They were troubled terribly in their souls,
and Julie, ignoring geometry, and all the equations of men, would seek
with her fore-shortened philosophies to set these simple minds right;
but she could see that they were not quite satisfied. There was no
doubt about it that the boys, still unsettled in their minds, went to
the priest, who received a very garbled version of her
explanations.</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s own little boys were in their seats an
hour before school opened, exhilarantly scratching their meager little
life experiences on their slates, or debating with one another in
bragging English. They loved the school, and lived in it in a state of
expectant excitement. Like little charmed birds they sat, while Julie
explained what became of the sun when it went away, and the wonderful
journey they were at that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>moment taking around it; whereupon
the boys would feel their desks for the barest fractions of the
movement of this celestial merry-go-round. They had an inordinate love
of fairy tales, and listened&mdash;poor little earth-grubs&mdash;with
widened eyes to the recounting of battles and heroes of far-away places
of the world.</p>
<p class="par">Julie never forgot those days. She could shut her eyes
long afterwards and see the monsoon bowing the banana trees and
scattering to the universe the golden host of the sacred tree of India,
rushing with its wild force to up-root their little tropical world. The
boys still sat in her memory in quivering wonder before the miracles of
the cosmos. The archipelago could never again be the limit of their
consciousness; it strayed now over the whole wide earth.</p>
<p class="par">But it was hard work through hot long days for a boy and
a girl, and the minds they were pulling out of savagery caught
half-way. To pull them up to the tidal mark of civilization would take
years, and it was just this staggering task that these two confronted.
With their buoyant young shoulders heaving at the wheel, James would
despairingly exclaim: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done. The whole race is
stuck right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie would set her teeth. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve got
to go through! The rest of humanity&rsquo;s done it. Remember
they&rsquo;ve had only a few hundred years, and look at the eons back
of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we sweated into our own souls, and they make
us sweat for theirs. What were they doing in our eons of advancement?
and who is fighting their savagery for them? We are!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie sighed. &ldquo;They are so eager, so anxious. I
get frightened sometimes as I sit before them; they accept me so wholly
as their creed. It comes over me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>that twenty years from now sixty
men will be thinking my thoughts. Oh, we&rsquo;ll get them,
sometime&mdash;and isn&rsquo;t it the most splendid work anybody could
engage in? To make a race! Why, you and I are sowing the dragon&rsquo;s
teeth, which shall spring up as the generation of light.&rdquo;

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie now entered into a phase of existence that
she had never before experienced. She was important to quite an
extensive number of people, not in the school alone&mdash;that was a
life apart&mdash;but in the delightful world into which she had
dropped. A young, trusting, and joyous figure, she stirred Nahal. Even
the Major, when she came within his range, emerged from his Hamlet
gloom and persuaded his facial muscles into a grim smile. To all the
others Nahal was exile; to Julie among so many eagerly attentive
people, a number of them men and young, who made a queen of her, Nahal
was life translated to some glorious star. Her work seethed in her soul
and kept her vivid; all those keen brown boys who were to grow up some
day were her star dust, out of which she was to create worlds.</p>
<p class="par">Life is the present, the philosophers have said. To the
young men Julie was the eternal feminine, while the magic of their
youth stirred hers. She was utterly unused to so much concentrated
attention. The earth was abundantly peopled with a kind race. She and
her followers spent the evenings on the Calcedos&rsquo; balcony, in the
midst of an assortment of banjoes, rocking in native hammocks and
keeping the night alive. Nothing at all went to sleep, not even the
birds irritatedly rustling among the leaves, nor the fireflies, nor the
timid Ghecko, who too horrible to be seen by day, crept out of his
mysterious retreat and offered his harsh bass voice at very close
range; nor Mike the Major&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76"
href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>monkey, across the road at
Head-quarters, where he squealed and begged abjectly to be let into the
fun; nor the natives drifting in their little boats out on the silver
water, with their guitars throbbing softly through the moonlight. Here
they swung and strummed, and defied the stars, and wondered&mdash;what
after Nahal? though into this speculation Julie never entered. She was
unqualifiedly satisfied with Nahal. It was a beautiful island, it was
paradise, and in it a great many remarkable things were to come to
pass.</p>
<p class="par">When she arose in the morning and drew into her nostrils
the perfume of the hills, when she came out into that early sunlight
that seemed to promise immortal things, when she had a real look into
that mysterious womb of nature, the jungle, she was electrified.
Everywhere there was so much light; it whetted the desire of living
into a passion.</p>
<p class="par">Thus Julie came into closer touch with native life. It
revealed itself more fully to her than to the rest of the colony.
Through the schools she saw just a little into the native&rsquo;s
heart, the heart of an imperfectly civilized child. She was also by her
zeal and indefatigable young strength impelled to go into the
night-school work. James had been struggling along with it alone. As
she came in out of the darkness, and gazed at that assemblage for the
first time, her throat went dry. Seventy-five of them huddled into a
room that had been built to accommodate half that number, men and women
crowded everywhere and lining the walls! There was something terrible
about such an assemblage, something that gripped the heart in a vise;
for almost none of them were young, many of them in fact were grizzled
and trembling into old age. Their hands were gnarled with hard work,
their faces blackened by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>the sun. Most of them were so poor
that a copper spelled existence; yet strangely, incomprehensibly, with
some blind hope in their darkened brains, they were here, and, with the
stupor of half-civilized drudges, were lifting up their eyes to the
emissary before them in fearful, blind appeal.</p>
<p class="par">Julie put her hand over her eyes. &ldquo;They are
looking at me as if I were God,&rdquo; she thought to herself.</p>
<p class="par">Often when the session was over, James and Julie
refrained from meeting each other&rsquo;s discouraged eyes. All day and
then at night, they had struggled with all their young strength to drag
a people over a margin. Never-to-be-forgotten nights were those, with
the dim lamp flickering above the long rows of benches, and the dark
trance of souls groping blindly for the light. They were struggling
against forces of the universe that would not be impelled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; James hopelessly
declared one night. &ldquo;They are too old. You can only get at the
young shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be too late, as long as they
aspire,&rdquo; Julie exclaimed, the tears springing to her eyes.
&ldquo;Think!&mdash;after plowing all day in the river bottoms, in mud
up to their waists, they come here in the few hours their poor souls
own. It means something, I say. It&rsquo;s a poor, twisted fragment of
the thing that wrested Mind out of the Universe!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only one life to live,&rdquo; James
declared, closing his books, &ldquo;and no more, Miss Dreschell, have
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If only we could see it through!&rdquo; Julie
sighed.</p>
<p class="par">She looked at the stars, as she walked home. Big shining
worlds rolling through space carrying the problem of Mind on into
infinity. Such a far journey man had yet to make. Isabel had told her
to go out and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>hold up the world. She was finding it glorious
business.</p>
<p class="par">Julie came out of the night with the star-light still in
her eyes. There was something stirring about her rapt, young presence,
as she ascended the stairs to the sala, that quickened the attention of
a tall young man who was rather hesitatingly awaiting her.</p>
<p class="par">The young man stood in full view, and her attention was
immediately attracted to his dignity of height and his direct gaze. She
liked his indomitable head, with its rigidly youthful contour and
surmounted by its upright crest of hair that glittered under the
hanging lamp like metal. She decided that what was so striking about
him was his superlatively untarnished look.</p>
<p class="par">He introduced himself as Lieutenant Calmiden. Julie
understood then that he was the Post Quartermaster, who had been
absent, in Solano, for supplies.</p>
<p class="par">They talked about Nahal, and he told her how much he
loathed it, and all other conceivable islands of the seas.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering what you could have
been thinking about as you came up the stairs,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You came in scattering light about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, I am only a glow-worm, who&rsquo;s apt to
lose his little torch any minute, however much I may wish to be an
archangel of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Angels are finished with experience; they are men
who have been sublimated to cold perfection. Don&rsquo;t you wish to
<i>live</i>, to experience, for yourself?&rdquo; the young man demanded
with intensity. Julie felt rather unaccountably impelled to say that
she did.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I used to live in this house, myself,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;It was bachelor quarters till the Calcedos teased it
back. There is a wonderful view from the balcony; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>I used
to sit and look at it by the hour. Come, and let me show it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They strolled out to the gallery. Calmiden pointed to
the causeway, a narrow strip of glistening land, looking in the
moonlight like a bridge flung between two worlds, with solid silver
masses of water on either side.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a strange roadway!&rdquo; Julie said.
&ldquo;What is at the other end?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Nobody ever goes over there.
There is a mass of legends about the causeway; one that in a great
cholera plague, the angels walking about the earth, lifted it out of
the water in order to go across. I imagine the volcano to the
south&mdash;whose red glow you can see on clear nights, against the
sky, as if the sea were on fire&mdash;had something to do with its
origin. I love it&mdash;-I feel as if it were to have something to do
with my fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These are such strange nights,&rdquo; Julie
reflected. &ldquo;They are too dramatic for sleeping; the universe
comes out from behind its curtain; they are nights for walking the
causeway alone with one&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The young man&rsquo;s straight gaze swerved quickly to
her. Julie had on a green gown, and the green bracelet, which rested on
the railing of the gallery. Of all the lovely shining things of the
night, the young man appeared to have decided, she was the loveliest,
and the most charming.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you wear that,&rdquo;&mdash;he gestured toward
the jade circle&mdash;&ldquo;because of your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wear it because somebody gave it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Somebody!&rdquo; the young man ejaculated in
forcible disappointment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A very beautiful woman in Manila, who had a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>tiny temple with a Green God in it&mdash;a
pitiless little Green God&mdash;presented it to me as a gift from him.
I met such strange vivid people up there. They called the woman who
gave me the bracelet the Empress of the East. There were
others&mdash;too,&rdquo; she paused, struck silent by a recollection.
&ldquo;How I should have loved,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to stay
there! Evidently it was meant that I should miss wonderful adventures.
I can only be a glow-worm on Nahal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is something about you that suggests that
you are to travel far. Oh, I hope not, Miss Dreschell. Don&rsquo;t go
any farther. Nahal might become something remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As he said good night, and held her hand in his,
Julie&rsquo;s thoughts took a sudden unintelligible turn, as if they
were never again to follow the old course. <span class=

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">While Julie was dealing, in a splendid glow, with
the affairs of the universe, her own mundane concerns, she was uneasily
aware, were urgently in need of attention. She retired one night to her
room, with the jungle closing up about it, and the jungle&rsquo;s wild
creatures rustling but a few feet away, to do some deep worldly
thinking. From her trunk she took the book in which she fitfully kept
accounts, and calculated furiously for some time, going over the
inexorable figures.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly she dropped the pencil, and sank back in her
chair, staring somberly into the night. Its blackness swept up to the
grated bars of the windows, and peered in at the solitary, harassed
figure in the cell.</p>
<p class="par">Not one dollar of the hundreds she owed Mrs. Morris had
been paid back. That very first, sacred responsibility her new life had
assumed! In Manila, money had unconsciously spent itself. Then, there
had been the expenses of the trip South. But bitterest fact of all, the
splendid wardrobe, the cause of all this trouble, had bit by bit,
impalpably and detestably, as if under an evil incantation, been giving
way. Dresses cracked explosively, at the touch, and silk stockings,
however prayerfully drawn on, disintegrated into an elemental snarl of
thread. What the elements did not demolish, the cockroaches, nearly as
big as mice and scrambling deftly all over the room, voraciously
devoured.</p>
<p class="par">Julie sat and burned with dishonor over her affairs.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>She felt as abased as if she had become the actual
chattel of her far-away creditor. She would have resorted to any
expediency to keep this bondage from being made public. The Dreschells
had an unconscionable pride. Mr. Dreschell had brought up his family on
the theory that borrowing money was only a shade less reprehensible
than stealing it. This obligation was the Debt of England to
Julie&rsquo;s soul. With her small salary, how, she pondered, was it to
be worked out?</p>
<p class="par">She had in her trunk one month&rsquo;s salary. Every bit
should go to the woman whose <i>peon</i> she had become. In forgetting
her own further necessity to exist, she was acting with characteristic
feminine recklessness. There being no post-office at Guindulman, Julie
rolled up the bills neatly, put them in an envelope, and addressed it
to Mrs. Morris. Thereupon her mental processes took quite a leap. She
arose with a shade even of self-satisfaction. It was splendid to be an
independent integer of the world&mdash;to handle your own
destiny&mdash;to say nothing of your own money&mdash;unafraid.</p>
<p class="par">Into the midst of these cogitations came the
Calcedos&rsquo; <i lang="es">muchacho</i>, to announce a young man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What young man?&rdquo; Julie demanded
particularly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">El Teserero!</i>&rdquo; the muchacho
declared.</p>
<p class="par">Julie dropped back flatly in her seat. Since the
uncomfortable and startling moments on the boat, she had contrived
never to meet the Treasurer alone. She knew how dissatisfied with this
he had been, and that in the midst of his activities planned to
supersede the Governor in power, he had been lying in wait for his
opportunity. She could see no way out of the encounter, and fortified
herself for it as she ascended the stairs to the sala. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Treasurer held her hand an instant and regarded her
closely with his odd light eyes. The surprisingly sun-burnt face wore a
look that sobered her. She indicated a chair.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Purcell demurred. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out on the
balcony,&rdquo; he suggested, regarding with disapproval the publicity
of their surroundings.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, I think I should rather remain here,&rdquo;
she replied lightly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t object to going out there with
the others,&rdquo; he reproached.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are several of them,&rdquo; Julie
explained.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How about Calmiden, and&mdash;others,&rdquo; he
probed with jealous meaning.</p>
<p class="par">Julie started slightly. How had he managed to be so well
informed concerning her movements?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why do you avoid me?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Do you think all these men are your friends? Wait and find out.
Now, I am serious. I care for you truly, as I told you on the boat. I
asked you to marry me; and I mean it still&mdash;in spite of your
evasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Julie begged.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have meant it&mdash;after those few
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She recalled her refusal&mdash;so adroit and impersonal,
in which her altruistic aspirations and her inviolate determination not
to marry had been calculated to carry conviction. She had wanted to
regard the matter as settled, yet here he was more determinedly
possessive than ever.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You did not dream that I had given up?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I beg of you to do so! I refuse
utterly!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything you&rsquo;ll be sorry
for later,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;Things are all your way now, but
wait <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>till they turn&mdash;till you find out none of
those fellows mean anything, and the bottom falls out of your
air-castle. Then you won&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared at him in resentful amazement. &ldquo;Mr.
Purcell,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this
conversation. You don&rsquo;t at all love me. You have merely set your
will upon me, and are trying to frighten me. Please never reopen this
subject.&rdquo; She rose. &ldquo;It is, so far as I am concerned,
definitely and completely closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll regret that!&rdquo; he exclaimed
agitatedly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you threatened me enough?&rdquo; Julie was
frantically angry now.</p>
<p class="par">She was aghast at the purpose that gathered in his face
as he replied: &ldquo;I do not wish to threaten you, but I have not
given up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He descended the staircase, leaving Julie with her
breast heaving.</p>
<p class="par">That wretched voyage! Had men gone mad in this queer
land, that they would ask a girl to marry them on a day&rsquo;s
acquaintance, and to this staggering casualness add the brigand
intention to seize her if she refused? According to this doggedly
unpleasant young man, he had put a mortgage upon her that he meant at
some time to exact. How many more people were to advance claims on her
life?</p>
<p class="par">To rid her mind of this uncomfortable visitor she
turned, on going downstairs, in the direction of Miss Hope&rsquo;s
room. The cheerful light shed through the partly open door drew her
forward. As she climbed the three steps that lifted the room from the
ground, she caught a glimpse of Mr. Brentwood&rsquo;s white starched
back. She started to retreat, but the young <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>man,
turning quickly at the sound of her footsteps, caught sight of her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why are you always out when I come to see
you?&rdquo; he reproached, smiling with his white teeth through his
carefully brushed mustache. &ldquo;I tried to call on you
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t out,&rdquo; Julie moodily replied,
remembering how much she had wished to be. &ldquo;I was
upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Brentwood directed upon Miss Hope a peculiar look.
&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he hospitably insisted. &ldquo;I can still see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s evil star beckoned her on. Miss Hope
offered no remark as she took a chair. Mr. Brentwood, promptly facing
around to Julie, proceeded to direct toward her the fullest extent of
his charms, and succeeded for once in being truly entertaining. Julie,
eager to forget her experience with Purcell, dropped gladly into a
sprightly discourse, and both of them forgot utterly the rigid figure
of the vestal virgin, which opposite them began to steam with
wrath.</p>
<p class="par">After they had laughed together for some time, Mr.
Brentwood bade Julie a lingering good-night, calling back a careless
adieu to the shape in the background.</p>
<p class="par">Julie turned to Miss Hope, but stopped short before the
spectacle of that lady who, having come out of the shadows, was
positively trembling with inconjectural passion. Her indefinite
features seemed to melt into a boiling lava, which strangely her face
appeared to be. Her blue eyes vehemently shot flames. Julie watched,
with interested daring, the forthcoming eruption.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Miss Dreschell,&rdquo; cried Miss Hope, bursting
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>wrath, &ldquo;you will seek quarters elsewhere. Do
you suppose it is entertaining for me to sit here all evening while you
monopolize my friends! Mr. Brentwood was my friend, Miss
Dreschell,&rdquo;&mdash;in rising crescendo&mdash;&ldquo;until you
came. My room and the Calcedos&rsquo; sala have other purposes than the
accommodation of the crowd of young men with which you seem to find it
necessary to surround yourself. Moreover, natives of the better class
have a sense of propriety, and it is not edifying to them to watch your
friends&mdash;and their caresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared incredulously. Then a realization of what
Miss Hope must mean flashed through her. Evidently she had seen in the
dusk under her window the wind-up of a gay tender little adventure with
Terry O&rsquo;Brien before he returned to command his mountain fastness
at Tarlac. It was never, Julie knew, to come to anything, and had
involved only a shadowy caress.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the Calcedos haven&rsquo;t said anything of
the kind!&rdquo; Julie objected with rising anger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They will say so. They have some cousins coming
to visit them,&rdquo; Miss Hope declared, pointing positively in the
direction of the door. She closed it sharply on Julie&rsquo;s outraged
back, leaving the girl to grope her way through the dark. Julie got to
the entrance, and stood there staring indignantly into the night.</p>
<p class="par">It was a charming night, all the worlds of the universe
spinning gayly up above her through the light of myriads of suns. It
must be really a very small concern to Uranus or to Neptune, where a
hundred years are as one, whether the atom called Miss Hope or the atom
called Purcell were angry or not. As for the atom called Julie dancing
headlong through space&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>was it even remotely possible that
somewhere, some place, any one atom tremendously counted? Was there a
law that held over those great worlds and their activities? And must
one conform to it? But how, with mystery on every side, were you to
find the law? Had she, because Purcell was not so pleasing as the
others, been intolerant of him? She had not been angry at the
sentimental intimations of the others. She had, in fact, poetically
enjoyed them. And Miss Hope&mdash;although she was, according to Julie,
terribly old, might she not still cling through a thousand yearning
desires to the magic garment of youth?</p>
<p class="par">Julie was not sure concerning all these speculations. A
strange consciousness seemed to be speaking through her, a
consciousness that saw things from all angles, but which only
occasionally broke into utterance.</p>
<p class="par">The approach of a tall, familiar figure put a stop to
this metaphysical trend of thought.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I came once before,&rdquo; Calmiden announced;
&ldquo;but I heard you in there with Miss Hope, so I decided to come
back later. Come take a walk as far as the steps of the <i lang=
"es">convento</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; Julie
demurred.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does it matter? Look at the
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie regarded it, and capitulated. They strolled up the
road that led to the upper part of the village. Street lights were
sparse and dim in Guindulman. The avenue was almost closed overhead by
the prodigal foliage of mango trees, and blackened with the soft, thick
darkness of the tropics; yet to-night it was meteorically lighted by
myriads of fire-flies shimmering in the branches.</p>
<p class="par">Julie threw up her head in wonder at the
transfiguration. Everything had become unreal. The avenue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>was like
a road in fairy-land. The <i lang="es">convento</i>, white as driven
snow in the moonlight, rose from its high tier of steps above them,
like an ancient temple.</p>
<p class="par">To the left was the Major&rsquo;s ogre-like retreat.
Mike, routed from his roost in the trees by this intolerable
illumination, was snarling and lashing through the branches like an imp
of darkness.</p>
<p class="par">This little gargoyle had been deliberately installed in
this tree commanding the entrance to his office by the Major, and Hell
itself could not have been more ferociously guarded by Cerberus. Men
could come and men could go; but to the whole female race Mike stuck
out his whiskered jaw in challenge. He might be swinging by his tail,
ever so happy and carefree, in the branches, but let a daughter of Eve,
however secretly, steal up to the portal of the omnipotent Major, and
he was down upon her with a thud, wildly rending her garments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wild little beast!&rdquo; Julie disapprovingly
declared, moving out of range of his chain. The monkey, like some
monster of elf-land, thrust his grotesque little head out of a nimbus
of fire-flies. He scratched them out of his eyes, and securing them
cunningly in his wicked little paws, bolted them with rapt relish.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; Julie cried. &ldquo;And they
were lighting up the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather handy to have round,
though,&rdquo; Calmiden hardily declared. &ldquo;You see I am
Quartermaster, and people want to bother one with such a multitude of
senseless things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They mounted the terraced steps, which in a sheer drop
fell from the walls of the <i lang="es">convento</i>.
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Julie pointed high above them. On the aerial
gallery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>of the <i lang="es">convento</i>, a black cassock
loomed stark against the night, a solitary brooding figure staring at
the stars. Once it bent intently to regard the two young persons.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; Calmiden exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; At sight of the priest a cloud had
come over Julie&rsquo;s mood.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so solitary, by race and vocation.
He&rsquo;s only half white, and only half a man. He might as well be a
magus up there in his tower, for all the participation he has in human
living. Wouldn&rsquo;t you be lonely if the gates of your soul&rsquo;s
territory were closed against you, if you were forbidden to
love&mdash;ever? He has fire in his eyes, our padre. He wasn&rsquo;t
made to tend altars on high mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my firm conviction,&rdquo; Julie
declared, &ldquo;that he tends very assiduously the fires of the
insurrection. He hates us; he hates all white men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because we are what but for a little slip of fate
he might have been. The tragedy, the wickedness of these racial
Lucifers flung down to a lower world!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Julie said soberly, looking
up at the Priest&rsquo;s tower, &ldquo;I fancy the padre doesn&rsquo;t
like me. These people don&rsquo;t understand our women&mdash;the woman
who walks through the world alone. To them she is an object of
suspicion; to their mind her liberty signifies licence. For instance,
to-night I oughtn&rsquo;t to be here&mdash;and he&rsquo;s looking down
on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does it matter what they think? So far as I
am concerned they don&rsquo;t exist. I am just serving my
time,&rdquo;&mdash;he closed his lips tightly; &ldquo;counting the
moments till I can get out and go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A brooding distant look came into the girl&rsquo;s eyes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To pass in and pass out? What good can that do?
One should put the plow into the soil and not abandon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d want to get clear of
the uncleanliness of this territory of Baal. I&rsquo;ve seen enough
raw, bestial nature over here to make my soul revolt. The standards
civilization has fought for go by the board here. One must be forever
on the lookout in the heart of half savage society to keep from
relapsing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just you wait till my boys grow up. Then
there&rsquo;ll come a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good God! You don&rsquo;t purpose staying over
here till then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl looked steadily into the night. &ldquo;If I did
the right thing I&rsquo;d stay. My little brown men lifted into the
citizenship of the world!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come down from your perch in the skies. What a
dreamer you are&mdash;and what a life to fling carelessly away! It
belongs to somebody or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nobody gives up anything anymore,&rdquo; Julie
went on. &ldquo;The renunciation that built up the world is going out
of it. Upon whose shoulders, if not upon ours, is the foundation of the
New World to rest? Isabel called me Atlas, and I have been so happy
holding up my little end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is terrible to speak of spending the years of
your life here. You don&rsquo;t at all know what you are talking about.
You don&rsquo;t know orientals. Wait till you see China, a half dead
am&oelig;ba sprawling over the earth. You will be overwhelmed by the
spectacle of humanity getting nowhere at all&mdash;just crawling along
the surface of the globe, like worms. Some day you will wrest yourself
out from these sunken millions in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>fearful prayer to get back to
your own kind. Oh, don&rsquo;t you feel the darkness, the despair of
it? There will never be any renaissance of the East&mdash;for to have a
renaissance you must have a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we are trying to make the start
here&mdash;that the fire may travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Among these inconsequential little swaggerers?
Even China, with her art and her senile one-man kind of learning, has
them beaten miles. My soul is sick of the whole debased East, I tell
you; and I despise this beastly hot-house of an archipelago that spawns
existence in such hideous profusion. I am no colonist, no pioneer,
ever. I am just a soldier, to restore order and pass on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t care at all about the great
struggle, that is commencing, everywhere over here? Ah, I can feel
it,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;&mdash;the powers of Light against the
powers of Darkness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden regarded her with profound feeling. &ldquo;You
are terribly young to be here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And already I have made two enemies,&rdquo; she
said with a change of mood. &ldquo;The very first of my life!&rdquo;
she reflected ruefully.</p>
<p class="par">He knitted his brows. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to think
of your having enemies in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They sprang up like a simoon in the desert. I was
angry for a bit, but I can&rsquo;t nurse a real good hatred in my soul
for five minutes. It just peters out, and of course that puts me at a
frightful disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A swift change came over the young man&rsquo;s face, an
inflexible sheath changing it into a mask of steel. &ldquo;I can stay
angry forever,&rdquo; he said, frowning into the night. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean that I have merely a bad temper. My mind simply will
not expurgate an affront. I love <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>and I hate for good,&rdquo; he
declared with concentrated passion.</p>
<p class="par">Julie drew away a little.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, but why dwell on such things, you and
I?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;All this would not have come out if you
had not stirred to the bottom, where the truth dwells. I may be violent
underneath, and hard with those who injure me, but there are any number
of things to which I am inflexibly true. I am as inexorable one way as
the other. I despise weakness of all kinds, and it is weak to let
people hurt you. I don&rsquo;t care what anybody says, if you let a
person hurt you lie will despise you into the bargain. It&rsquo;s too
bad, but I can&rsquo;t be changed&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad somehow that
I made a clean breast of it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You frighten me a little by the order that is all
through you. Even your sins appear to have unity, whereas I keep house
topsy-turvily in my innermost being. I have nothing filed there. I
don&rsquo;t know what will flash out at any moment. I am camping in the
universe&mdash;and having for the present a tremendous time. Some
policeman will come along some time and take me in because I
haven&rsquo;t built a house in creation. But just now there is
adventure, and the glory of being alive under the tents of
Kedar.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She smiled up at the moon. &ldquo;I wonder where I am
heading?&rdquo; she exclaimed. Her glance dropped, she stopped talking,
and her face lit up softly; her attention claimed by something she
seemed to see off in dusky space. Calmiden watched her for some moments
where she stood on the step of the old convent with the moonlight
flowing over her like a timeless river.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you seeing off there?&rdquo; he asked.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Faces! Faces&mdash;startling ones that I saw in
Manila&mdash;made by the New World. I often think and wonder about
them&mdash;about one, more often!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Calmiden echoed
blankly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A god&rsquo;s&mdash;with the heart of all the
world beating in his breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you think about him!&rdquo; he exclaimed in
gloomy dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="par">The girl roused herself. &ldquo;It was only the
encounter of an instant,&rdquo; she mused wistfully. &ldquo;It would be
very foolish to think of just one moment out of one&rsquo;s life, would
it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She turned suddenly, for the thought had surged over her
again that she had not in any way heard from Manila since she had left
it behind&mdash;that in the busy, brilliant lives into which she had
fluttered for an instant she was not even a recollection. Apparently in
these strenuous times it was every man to his own road! She had chosen
her road&mdash;but she had never ceased to remember those beautiful
days and nights.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she told the young man.
&ldquo;I must go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before she went to bed, she put out her light and,
wrapped in the thick darkness, stared out on the swaying groves. Far
down the avenues her gaze pierced, as if some message were stirring
toward her from off there. Soon she was asleep, close to the evil,
perfumed earth.</p>
<p class="par">As Julie went pondering along the golden dust-powdered
road, she was confronted at the convent steps by Anna Anastasia, the
Priest&rsquo;s mother, who accosted her with the freedom of manner that
was part of her efflorescent personality.</p>
<p class="par">Once long ago Anna Anastasia had been pretty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>enough to ensnare the attention of a rich young
Spanish official. The Priest was the issue of their irregular alliance,
and against its consequences his soul perpetually rebelled. This light,
fluid creature had inexorably fixed his fate. The desires of her soft
little body had made him what he must unchangeably remain. Far from
being a Magdalene, however, Anna Anastasia, as the mother of the
Priest, occupied in this elastic human community a position of almost
religious eminence.</p>
<p class="par">Nodding sociably at the girl, she said in Spanish:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told you seek accommodations.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie looked harassed. Had she not been everywhere
unsuccessfully over this crowded town and finally been advised
amazingly by the Governor to marry the Teserero in order to put an end
to her troubles?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s maddening,&rdquo; she replied, pushing
her damp blond hair from her brow, &ldquo;but there seems to be none to
be had!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Se&ntilde;ora smiled archly. &ldquo;Quite true;
there are none. It seems a shame that so young and so charming a
se&ntilde;orita should be distressed. I am lonely!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo;&mdash;she shrugged her
shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;the pleasantest living in the world with Raoul.
If he could become more human&mdash;if he would find something to take
his black thoughts off himself, and off me! Would you believe it,
Se&ntilde;orita, he keeps me a close prisoner&mdash;me who am but
thirty-eight? Many women marry, and have lovers still, very suitably,
at my age. Always he makes life hell by demanding, &lsquo;Why did you
do it?&rsquo; Why indeed! It would be well for him to see that it is
not easy to resist. His father was a cavalier. You can see it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>in Raoul, who is so tall and strong and beautiful,
as you are. Raoul is of a higher race.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come to live with me in the <i lang=
"es">convento</i>, and I will give you every comfort. Things must be
made easier for me, Se&ntilde;orita; truly they must. I should love
Raoul to go through purgatory&mdash;to learn that outside his breviary
there is a heaven and a hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie stood turning color under a mixture of violent
emotions. This impossible and monstrously unconcerned woman actually
expected an answer to her unthinkable proposal. But even in the midst
of suffocating emotions, Julie remembered that she must be careful of
giving offense to so powerful a person. &ldquo;It is
inconceivable!&rdquo; she exclaimed, drawing away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But why, Se&ntilde;orita? You like men. There are
always many around you. It was so too with me. Make Raoul eat the
dust!&rdquo; Her face set into passionate lines of hatred.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared <span class="corr" id="xd21e1476" title=
"Source: dumfounded">dumbfounded</span> at the woman who claimed her as
a sister spirit. &ldquo;This is horrible,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My son says you are beautiful, but that you are
evil. The other se&ntilde;orita, he says, is too old for sin. You see
that he is very harsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie was trembling now. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;it is too much.&rdquo; She hurried back to her jungle
room, clenching her hands, and letting the angry tears flow.</p>
<p class="par">That afternoon, Maria Tectos, the Old Maid of
Guindulman, one of the most noteworthy personages of the village, not
only as the possessor of considerable wealth but as the acknowledged
leader among the women, hailed Julie as the girl trudged by. She
offered Julie a room in her large house, which was the best and most
unique mansion in the town. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It was distinctly a compliment, Julie understood, to be
invited to join this exclusive household. The Old Maid had been to a
school in Manila; moreover, with her ultra-modern, tremendous,
iron-gray pompadour shaking always like a tower with her laughter, she
would be a jolly companion. She believed, so she was always averring to
Julie, in the complete freedom of her sex; and she was constantly
stirring the women up to one thing or another; but this feministic
progressiveness unfortunately carried along with it the conservatism of
old age. The exactions the Old Maid imposed would leave Julie none of
that liberty the Old Maid extolled. Julie could see her young men
friends only under the Old Maid&rsquo;s eye; and it became clear that
everything would be done to discourage altogether their foolish visits.
The Old Maid pointed out her own successful single, elderly state as a
contrast to that of her companions.</p>
<p class="par">After the sinister proposition of the morning, and the
accompanying insinuations, the Old Maid&rsquo;s invitation seemed a
real elucidation of her problem. The view of her entertained by Anna
Anastasia and the priest was peculiar to their own dark minds. The
others knew that she had come here to give all she could. But it was
troublesome that their appreciation of conventions so
disproportionately exceeded their realization of ethics. These people
whose Atlas she had come to be, might not at all understand her living
alone, as she had been thinking of doing, in a little house which she
had discovered she could rent. Perhaps, after all, since she had made
this her particular task, and was getting really to have quite a hold
on some of the people, she had better accept the Old Maid&rsquo;s
stringent proffer. So with a strange feeling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>that
this decision would be ultimately critical, she told the Old Maid that
she would come.</p>
<p class="par">When she returned from school at five o&rsquo;clock,
Calmiden stood waiting outside the closed Headquarters.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late,&rdquo; he exclaimed, coming
toward her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie regarded him gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Finding a roof for one&rsquo;s head is
harder than I thought it was. You know that Miss Hope has made the
Calcedos put me out. I&rsquo;ve been everywhere, and had the strangest
things said to me&mdash;&rdquo; She paused gloomily. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ve succeeded at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he demanded
quickly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To Maria Tectos. She has offered to take me in.
She is very powerful, and I shall be very comfortable,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She has made stipulations. She does not approve
of my seeing men alone, or walking out with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, you told her you wouldn&rsquo;t go to her,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I told her I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden stopped short with a forcible exclamation.
&ldquo;Why, she will never let us see each other! I say, you are not
going to let that happen? Do you want to give up life completely, sit
up alone night after night in the dusk among the palms in this desolate
bit of jungle? You don&rsquo;t know what it is, I tell you&mdash;this
dark alien land. Every atom of it makes you feel your abandonment. This
country&rsquo;s not for women anyway. It&rsquo;s for armed marching
men. I can&rsquo;t think how you dropped into it. How did you?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie started. &ldquo;I think&mdash;somebody said
something to me once on a roof top.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I am talking to you now from the ground
floor. Life is short enough anyway, and you propose to cut off all its
possibilities by burying yourself in the wilderness even more
effectually than you have done already. Why it&rsquo;s insulting the
high gods who made you the lovely being you are. Maria Tectos&mdash;and
all the natives be dashed when they try to dictate your mode of
living!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie stood looking soberly down into the dust of the
sun-burnt road. The life of a hermit on the island of Nahal! Could one
even for the most inexorable principles endure it?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to get awfully hard!&rdquo;
She sighed. &ldquo;Sometimes I long so to go back to Manila&mdash;I
really had no idea of being so completely put out of the world. I
thought I should work very hard, and win my certificate to title among
the Builders. There appeared to be very little real work left for me in
Manila&mdash;and it didn&rsquo;t seem fair to play safe over courses
already won. But I really didn&rsquo;t expect to be so cut
adrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She straightened up, and smiled. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Calmiden pressed closer. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t
walk in the dusk, ever any more, Julie, among the mango trees, with the
fire-flies all about us, or sit on the wharf and watch the little
boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s gaze dropped again in heavy thought.
Calmiden was looking at her closely.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What lovely hair you have! Oh! do be kind to
yourself, and to all the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She lifted her head. &ldquo;Why, anyway, should it make
any difference in the long run what I do about it?&rdquo; she demanded
of the universe.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; Calmiden
exclaimed joyously.</p>
<p class="par">Still Julie hesitated. But the instincts of youth and
the joy of living had won the struggle in her breast.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p class="par">When Julie went to the mess that evening, she found the
Major scowling heavily at the table cloth. He announced at last:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just received an order from the Department which
revokes commissary privileges for civilians. This will of course
deprive them of the privilege of Army messes. I seldom make any comment
upon my orders, but right now this appears to be particularly
unfortunate. We are a remote and inaccessible unit of society, facing
the roughest conditions; and now some of us are about to be completely
cut loose. Supplies will have to be procured in Solano, from Shylocks
who exact excessive prices. They must <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>be requisitioned at
once, but until they arrive, I shall, on my own responsibility, keep
this mess open.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He looked at Julie as he spoke. From the first, he had
made her his special charge. The girl was aghast. For the purchase of
large supplies she had no money, having despatched it all to her
creditor across the ocean. She left the room heavily, and groped her
way down the road. There were no fire-flies to light the world
to-night.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly some one stepped out from among the trees and
softly spoke her name. He made a quick sign for silence, and she
suppressed the incredulous cry that had sprung to her lips.</p>
<p class="par">It was Adams, dropped down from the skies; for how else,
with Dao on the other side of the island, could he have gotten
here?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My hour came, and I bolted!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ridden without sleep two days through a wilderness.
The ogre wouldn&rsquo;t let me have a leave; but I persuaded him to
give me a three-day hunting pass to go after deer in the mountains.
Don&rsquo;t know how I ever got through; and if the Major should find
it out&mdash;or any of them&mdash;I&rsquo;d be court-martialled and
chucked. There seems to be a path in this grove, which we can follow to
get out of the way of observation. I came, of course, to talk to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The path ran not far from the Old Maid&rsquo;s house,
into the copse. It brought them upon the deserted end of an estate,
where a small house could be seen deeply sheltered in the trees.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice place&mdash;sort of a wild
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They settled themselves upon a log. The moon coming out
from behind clouds broke only fitfully into these woodland depths. All
around them was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>soft still dusk, and a mysterious
pensiveness in the night.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I had to come,&rdquo; Adams declared. &ldquo;I
wanted to see human beings, I wanted to talk to you. There&rsquo;s an
appetite of the spirit that has to be satisfied. I haven&rsquo;t had
any dinner, nor what you might call any lunch, but I don&rsquo;t care.
I&rsquo;ve run amuck to get here. I couldn&rsquo;t stand living with
the lower man any longer. Doc&rsquo;s gone, and there were just the
ogre and myself!&rdquo; He rested his elbows on his knees, and dropped
his head heavily in his hands. &ldquo;The men are sick and going down.
The falling white man drops till there is nothing white about him but
his skin! I won&rsquo;t be that. I won&rsquo;t go down with the rest!
Oh, I&rsquo;ve a right to live!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I fled over the mountains, I would have gone
through blood for this instant&rsquo;s reunion with the decencies of my
kind. To-night with my hat pulled over my eyes, I walked into the post
when it was getting dark. I left my horse outside the village, and as I
passed every house, I looked into it like a ghost. What a jolly little
group! The Major was in his window, his iron old face turned to the
hills, planning, I&rsquo;ll bet, red-hot campaigns that would put his
honor at rest. Good, decent old fellow, dressed in his stiff white. You
ought to see how we go to dinner in Dao&mdash;or rather, you
shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There was old Bent, sewing on a button by the
light of a lamp, and Dwight, a few feet away, reading a paper in a
hammock, with Mike sitting on his head. Calmiden was out on the back
gallery, with his feet wound round his tilted chair, staring at the
sunset or the island, or something over there.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Three of the fellows all together. I used to make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>the fourth. We used to play cards, and read our
letters out loud.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Little Mrs. Smith, farther on, was bending over a
photograph in the dusk&mdash;that one of Marlborough taken in Cuba, I
suppose. It made me wish I&rsquo;d had a romance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are about the only girl I ever thought about.
But think how long it will be before I see you again! And then there
are all these men here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Time passed unnoticed by the two sitting on the log amid
the silvery lights and shadows, reviewing the experiences of youth and
confiding to each other its ideals. Those hours were printed forever on
Julie&rsquo;s memory. Long afterwards she could recall Adams as he had
sat with the moonlight playing about the shadow of his figure and his
pondering gaze bent upon the encroaching darkness, and the way he had
said, throwing out his arms, &ldquo;Every time I stretch out my
hand&mdash;it seems to come up against an invisible wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he exclaimed
suddenly.</p>
<p class="par">A man in white was coming out of the house. He opened
the gate in front of them.</p>
<p class="par">Julie hesitated. She had identified the secret
residence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is the house of Nemecia Victoria,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The village Tha&iuml;s! That was an American. No
native is so tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He rose soberly. &ldquo;I must go back and sit on the
lid of my little hell. I&rsquo;m all right now. I went wild, and have
done a mad thing, but it has set me right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They strolled along close to the fence that cut the
woods off from the public road. They stopped at the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1594" title="Source: delapidated">dilapidated</span> gate. He
took her hands in his. &ldquo;Dear, little, unforgettable friend of a
few hours! We have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span>both to stick to our outposts now, but
these times can&rsquo;t last forever. Till better days then, and
don&rsquo;t let me pass out of your thoughts! Good-by!&rdquo; He bent
down and kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p class="par">Then he struck off at once into the darkness of the
thicket. Julie watched motionlessly at the gate till the shadowy form
disappeared. She had been groping around in darkness for a hand, and
suddenly, out of another&rsquo;s extremity, one had come to meet her
own. Adams and she had both deeply become involved in a great struggle.
They had both, the girl subconsciously felt, been elected to the
destiny of the East. Between them there was a cemented bond. By himself
&ldquo;holding out,&rdquo; he had helped her across the ditch.</p>
<p class="par">A sound close at hand caused her to look around quickly.
The figure of a man in white was turning down a side street, not a few
yards away. Julie recognized it as the same figure that she and Adams
had seen emerge from Nemecia Victoria&rsquo;s house. <span class=

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A few days later, the Major, who had sat
throughout his dinner in gloomy silence, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a
telegram from Templeton. He says Adams left Dao five days ago on a
three-day hunting pass, and he hasn&rsquo;t returned. He says Adams has
had it in his head all along to visit Guindulman, and he is sure now
that he must have tried to get across, a mad man&rsquo;s undertaking!
And of course he didn&rsquo;t make it, or we should have heard from
him. Brentwood,&rdquo; blaming the Adjutant, as he always did when he
was disturbed, &ldquo;why hadn&rsquo;t Adams been
transferred?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recall your saying anything about
it, sir,&rdquo; Brentwood pacifically replied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If he tried to come here there&rsquo;s a reason
for his being so long on the way, and he&rsquo;ll be court-martialled
for his pains. Even with a map this wilderness is hard to wade through.
But if he actually went hunting, he has met with foul play. Hunting in
this country alone! What judgment Templeton ever had is dissolved in
whiskey, and Adams has gone stark mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Adams has been in Dao for nearly two years,
seeing only an occasional Spanish launch captain, and a
dipsomaniac,&rdquo; Mrs. Smith remarked.</p>
<p class="par">The Major was too deeply worried to challenge this.
&ldquo;We have no way of knowing what he did do. I have telegraphed
O&rsquo;Brien to take out some men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie who had sat listening, with staring eyes and a
fevered face, gazed in fright at the Major. Adams <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>had
enjoined absolute secrecy concerning his dash in and out of Guindulman.
If she were to disclose his adventure, she would expose him to military
trial. If she did not&mdash; She gazed round the anxiety-weighted
table, and tried with palpitating heart to come to a decision.</p>
<p class="par">After dinner, walking agonizedly down the hill, she
tried again to think what to do. Adams had said it might take him two
or three days to get back. If he should arrive back, safely, it might
appear that he had been lost on his deer hunt; how could she dare to
subject him to court-martial? How, on the other hand, could she dare
risk his life by another hour&rsquo;s loss of time in telling what she
knew? His safety came first of all.</p>
<p class="par">She retraced her way, and knocked timidly at the
Major&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p class="par">He opened it himself, looking at her rather strangely,
she thought.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Major!&rdquo; she
faltered distressfully.</p>
<p class="par">He flung away his cigar, and invited her in.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t the Commanding Officer, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard. There must be moments when you are not;
couldn&rsquo;t I claim one of those?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Major deliberated. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better
tell you that I have just become acquainted with what I believe you
have come to disclose.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean about Mr. Adams?&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Oh, nobody knew that he was here, but me&mdash;and I have not
breathed it to a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One other person knew, for he has just reported
to me the exact time that Adams left the village, and with whom he
spent his time while here.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He spent it with me,&rdquo; Julie doggedly
declared. &ldquo;He was lonely, going mad under that monster at Dao. He
wanted to see civilization again. This was what meant civilization to
him. Doesn&rsquo;t that seem awful, after what he has stuck
through?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But would he risk his life, to say nothing of his
commission, for such an impulse?&rdquo; Some thought, some intimation
that projected from the mind of the unknown person who had seen Adams
and herself, stretched back of the Major&rsquo;s words. Julie&rsquo;s
unpleasant experiences of late had commenced to sharpen her wits. The
Major&rsquo;s informant, it was clear, had had something horrid to say.
The kiss! The disappearing figure of that man&mdash;who could he have
been! She began to be frightened. Glancing up, she saw that the Major
perceived photographically all that was in her mind.</p>
<p class="par">She cast about desperately in her thought. The
Major&rsquo;s conservatism must be won over, if one of her
spirit&rsquo;s company were to be saved from disgrace. It was useless
to try to penetrate the understanding of this grim, practical man with
the things Adams had poured out to her on the log that evening in the
thicket; idle to deal in symbols with the soldier before her. Well,
there was always the final, smashing conventional fact!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mr. Adams and I,&rdquo; she faltered, groping for
the word, &ldquo;had an understanding. It was for that that he risked
his life&mdash;for me. I met him at Dao, and we had corresponded. Oh,
please try to find him!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has probably got on the wrong trail,&rdquo;
the Major reassured her, &ldquo;and will turn up in Dao yet.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you will do nothing awful to him?&rdquo; she
pleaded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We will do the best we can within the scope of
the regulations, of course. He&rsquo;s had a tough time of it, and the
fact of your being here just swept him out of his senses,
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie walked dazedly to the door. There she paused, and
asked almost fiercely: &ldquo;May I ask, Major, who your informant in
this matter was?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am sorry&rdquo;&mdash;the Major appeared
troubled&mdash;&ldquo;but I promised not to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Adams&rsquo;s danger swept Julie&rsquo;s mind of every
other thought. She was aware, nevertheless, of how fearfully, on the
spur of the moment, she had complicated, the situation that she had
attempted to save.</p>
<p class="par">She knew very little about military trials, but she was
sure that in a time like this, actually one of war, an officer who had
deliberately left his post in violation of orders, or in wilful
misconstruction of permission, to travel through a hostile country, was
in for a bad time of it, and possibly for disgrace. Any extenuating
circumstances that she could advance it seemed her duty to offer, at
whatever personal cost. But what of their future relations&mdash;of a
bond cemented like this? In casting herself away, characteristically,
on the instant, to save Adams, she had never given a thought to the
issue.</p>
<p class="par">Terry with his detachment of men was sent out from
Tarlac in search of Adams. The Major also dispatched a force from his
own garrison over the route that Adams had probably taken on his
return. The country was wild and inaccessible, and it was hoped that he
had merely gotten lost. For several days nothing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>was
heard from the searching parties. The Major&rsquo;s suspense, together
with that of the whole garrison, grew painful. It was about the time of
the atrocities in Negros and Samar, and the Americans knew not what
each dark day might bring forth.</p>
<p class="par">Several days later both parties came into Guindulman
bringing Terry, dangerously wounded, and the body of Adams. He had been
murdered in the hills&mdash;had lost his life in the new country that
he had served.</p>
<p class="par">After turning the country upside down, Terry had
discovered Adams&rsquo;s horse in one of the dark little villages, and
had forced the populace to disclose what had become of Adams. He found
that Adams had come through the village very tired and hungry, and had
asked for some food and a place to sleep for a few hours. He had a fine
horse, a good pistol, and obviously some money; so the <i lang=
"es">presidente</i> had proffered him a dinner of hot chicken and had
led him to a room. While he slept the <i lang="es">presidente</i> and
his accomplices had strangled him with a rope, and thrown his body in a
hole on the river bank.</p>
<p class="par">After administering summary justice to these villains,
Terry had started back, only to be caught himself in a bamboo trap laid
in a <i>nipa</i> hut, into which he had stepped after reading a placard
on the outside addressed to the Americans and promising that
information of value could be obtained inside. Terry had fallen through
the false floor which had been laid over sharpened bamboo poles planted
below.</p>
<p class="par">The priest refused to allow Adams&rsquo;s body even
temporary sepulture in the cemetery of Guindulman, declaring that,
since he was not a catholic, Adams could not be admitted to consecrated
ground. The Major refused to take the priest&rsquo;s objections
seriously, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>pointed out the fact that, in default of
sepulture tax, the bones of those interred were unceremoniously thrown
out of the graveyard. However over-crowded the cemetery might be, room
for the present, the Major declared, must be made for the remains of
the dead officer. It was a note-worthy fact that in Nahal there had
never been sufficient accommodation for either the living or the
dead.</p>
<p class="par">The quarrel ended in the annexation to the cemetery of a
bit of outside territory. So it was in unconsecrated ground, in a
lonely corner of alien forests, that Adams was put to rest.</p>
<p class="par">The sun beat down on the open grave, and on the rude
box. A strange hush lay over the tropical atmosphere. Adams&rsquo;s
horse, with his master&rsquo;s boots reversed against the saddle, stood
arching his neck with sad pride.</p>
<p class="par">The Major read the burial service. His harsh voice broke
as he spoke of the good soldier Adams had been, and a tear stole down
his stern cheek. The men pulled their hats down over their eyes, while
Julie stole forward weeping and sprinkled flowers over the friend who
had stepped out forever from the problem of the East. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A desperate situation now confronted Julie. For
two weeks she had been exhausting her ingenuity trying to keep her
household going. The wages of Gregorio, the cook, were unpaid, and
trifling with the pocket of a desperado is never wise&mdash;for it was
patent from his physiognomy that Gregorio was an insurrecto, or about
to become one. All of Julie&rsquo;s affairs had been in suspense
pending the arrival of her month&rsquo;s salary. Then word had come
that the boat carrying mail between Manila and Solano had been wrecked
and the teachers&rsquo; checks lost. Cablegrams sent to the chaotic
Department in Manila evoked no response. Miss Hope, the itinerant
Cr&oelig;sus, did not seem embarrassed by the catastrophe; duplicates
would undoubtedly be sent in time. But Julie could not wait another
minute.</p>
<p class="par">James brought hope into Julie&rsquo;s despair, however,
by informing her that Miss Hope had told him that the Treasurer was
prepared to advance officially temporary loans to straitened teachers.
This was salvation through the gate of purgatory; for Julie desperately
hated to approach Purcell in a capacity that would permit him to assume
the aspect of bestowing a favor upon her.</p>
<p class="par">But her affairs had come to such a pass that there was
no alternative to be considered. She owed pressing debts around the
town, to say nothing of those in Solano; and they all hurt her prestige
as a teacher. She knew that she would have to go to him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The evening after the burial of Adams, Calmiden
appeared, to bid Julie good-by before leaving the next morning to take
the field. The troops, with the exception of a small detachment for the
protection of the post, had been ordered out to punish the lawless
elements of the islands. Adams&rsquo;s death had uprooted the
Major&rsquo;s last inner reluctance. He was at last going to take the
responsibility of acting.</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden sat down on the steps and looked about him at
the miserable little house.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible to think of your living here
alone. There are three of us together there across the plaza. I thought
of course that some one of those women would take you in. Aren&rsquo;t
you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo; the girl said
slowly. &ldquo;I have the musical clock, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie stirred uncomfortably. &ldquo;It sings when the
night is long and lonely&mdash;after the golden wine-bibbers, with
their careless voices, have passed on; it sings through that dead stop
of the night when people die on earth. Then I am afraid, until I
hear&mdash;well, do you ever hear strange things? Did you ever sit up
and listen, and hear the powers of the invisible universe sweep by?
Some denizen down deep in me responds to all this, and makes out it
knows what is going on. Otherwise it would be horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His face grew grave. &ldquo;You should never have come
here to undergo such things! Ah, what do you think you are making of
life amid such hardships?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Julie downcastly
replied. &ldquo;How can any one know until the sum is finally cast up?
I am still trying to cast up the sum of Jack Adams&rsquo;s life, and
make it come out right. The memory of our brief poignant talks, with
the moan of isolated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>forests in them, comes back to
me&mdash;&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice broke.</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden glanced at her quickly. &ldquo;You think a good
deal about him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Then he added, as if to get
away from the thought, &ldquo;Poor Jack! However did he come to do it?
He seems to have lost his head over there. The Major knows what
happened, but he never says a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie leaned forward earnestly. &ldquo;Do you think that
Jack understands&mdash;that it was worth while; that what he did over
there all counted in the project&mdash;in the whole big scheme? For you
see, he used to say we were grist for the mill&mdash;he and I; and I
never understood that. It seems sort of disquieting to recall
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you see that, even if the
revolution, or evolution, you talk about did come over here, you are
too slight a fabric for such a thing? You don&rsquo;t belong in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m not strong? My aunt said that,
too,&rdquo; she pondered sorrowfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And if you were strong? Adams was strong, and he
lost his life. If you play for big stakes over here, sometime
you&rsquo;ve got to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie sat very still. At last she drew a letter from her
dress, and held it before her in the dim light.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is such a strange letter,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s so odd that it came just at the time
Adams was killed. It&rsquo;s from that beautiful woman whom I told you
they call the Empress of the East&mdash;and who, when I left Manila of
my own free will, said I was mad to throw away my life. She is the only
one I met there who has written to me. One individual counts for so
little there&mdash;you understand. Well, I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>did
not completely drop out of her mind, anyway! Listen to what she
says:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Atlas: The Green God has told me to
write to you. I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;since he never gives
reasons, nor answers questions. What has happened to you? Has the earth
begun to tremble and slip from those white young shoulders? Or why does
the Green God fear for the Shining Apostle to the East, and direct me
to recall myself to you and cause you to bear in mind that there is
always&mdash;Isabel?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden snatched the letter agitatedly. &ldquo;Who is
this Eastern Witch? What on earth does she mean? What has her horrible
God to do with you? Promise me that you will never answer that letter,
or go near her again!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed, I shall probably never see her again,
since my destiny lies down in jungles, and hers in the beautiful places
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden dropped the letter, and regarded Julie with
emotion. &ldquo;And so this was your choice? Indomitable little being,
with the luminous faith! Do you know that this island which I hated so
with my whole soul&mdash;where the days were but blank heat waves and
the nights a horrible hush&mdash;has become paradise since you walked
into it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His tone took on a poignant wistfulness. &ldquo;But your
eyes seem to take you always out of my reach.... Ah, do you, after all,
belong to the Green God?&mdash;you who say you have thrown in your lot
with the East!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before Julie could reply, Brentwood came up the steps,
and announced that the Major wanted Calmiden at once. Calmiden went
away with him, throwing back of him a long glance. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The next day, Julie, gathering together the courage of
necessity, went to see the Treasurer about the projected loan to the
teachers.</p>
<p class="par">Her heart beat violently as she climbed the stone
flights of the Ayuntamiento, in the left wing of which the civil
government offices were located. Purcell was in the Treasury, seated at
his desk. As Julie appeared before him, a strange alteration flashed
through his light eyes; a swift omen, gone before it could be
captured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; he said, politely rising.
&ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There was a preparedness in his attitude that cast the
girl down more than ever. That it should be to him that things had
finally led! She shrank from him almost visibly, and longed unutterably
for retreat; but consciousness of her disastrous concerns pressed like
a red-hot weight on her brain.</p>
<p class="par">Purcell, never removing his eyes from her downcast face,
waited. If Julie by some chance had glanced up at that
moment!&mdash;but that abysmal ignorance concerning human nature which
her uncle had deplored blinded her to the subtleties in which she was
about to become enmeshed.</p>
<p class="par">She lifted her eyes with a terrible effort, and Purcell
immediately dropped his.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Miss Hope says that you are advancing money out
of the Treasury to the teachers, till their salaries arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Purcell made a sudden movement, but did not speak.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have come on that errand. When my money comes I
will repay you promptly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Still studying the flushed, downcast face of the girl,
Purcell reached out his arm to the safe and began to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>move
the knob of the combination. &ldquo;How much do you wish?&rdquo; he
asked in a low voice.</p>
<p class="par">As little as was humanly possible to get along on, was
Julie&rsquo;s thought. It was torture to stand here and have money
doled out to her by this man. She hesitated and finally murmured,
&ldquo;Thirty dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He glanced up quickly from the safe, almost in
disappointment, she thought. He brought out a great roll of bills which
he held before the girl&rsquo;s eyes while he slowly counted out the
sum she had asked for.</p>
<p class="par">Julie took the money with a quivering word of gratitude.
After all, there was no such thing as hatred in the world!</p>
<p class="par">Purcell, with an abrupt gesture, turned away.</p>
<p class="par">Julie went home with the wherewithal to make the world
turn a little longer. Gregorio was paid, and thus enriched, lit out for
the hills to the solar plexis of the insurrection, where by virtue of
his brigand appearance he belonged.</p>
<p class="par">The troops returned after a vigorous quest of the
insurrectos, whom they had been able to engage but once. Owing to the
impenetrable character of the country, the insurgents had managed
everywhere to hide themselves from conflict. Balked and baffled by the
unabashed desperados sitting unattainably upon their horrible hills,
the Major was in a furious frame of mind. With his limited facilities,
he seemed powerless to cope with the situation; and unless something
should intervene in his behalf, it seemed that these people, who, as
Delphine had expressed it &ldquo;greatly enjoyed to insurrect,&rdquo;
would go on warring forever, through savage lust of the thing.</p>
<p class="par">One morning shortly after the Major&rsquo;s return,
Julie, on her way to school, became aware of some deep agitation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>that was shaking the village. From hut to hut,
some tremendous portent had flashed as if by racial telepathy, till
every soul in the village was aware of it. Julie, looking up at their
windows where they were foregathered, brown secret beings with terror
in their gestures, was unable to get any clew to the mystery.</p>
<p class="par">Upon reaching the school house, she was handed a letter
which she read with much astonishment. It was from the Old Maid, and
requested, in the name of the mothers of the children, that school be
suspended that afternoon. Moreover, the Old Maid besought Julie with
all the fervor of the Spanish language to come to her house at two
o&rsquo;clock, for an &ldquo;<i lang="es">asunto muy
importante</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie learned a little later, to her further
mystification, that the girls&rsquo; school would likewise be dismissed
at twelve, for the day.</p>
<p class="par">Returning home at the noon hour, Julie found the little
houses on stilts looking strangely deserted. Apprehension seized her.
Had the women too decamped for the hills?</p>
<p class="par">Promptly at two o&rsquo;clock, she walked down the hill
to the Old Maid&rsquo;s mansion, and found in that formidable
vestal&rsquo;s extensive grounds all the women of Guindulman, as well
as those from the neighboring districts, as far even as Loboc. Every
dusky sister of them was in a high state of consternation. As if that
were not astounding enough, they had attached indissolubly to their
persons very nearly all the children in the world&mdash;and these were
shrieking in panic. As Julie quickly recognized, the barren and the
unwedded had appropriated as their share the orphaned and deserted; and
the orphaned and deserted were howling in apparent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>rebellion at belonging to anybody at all. Even
the Old Maid had one wriggling little goddess of the dust&mdash;whom
she ordinarily smacked soundly for poaching on her
premises&mdash;touchingly tucked under her arm.</p>
<p class="par">Delphine alone had been able to elude these theatrical
adoptions, and skipped satirically free among the leaves. The moment,
however, that he glimpsed his teacher, he ran up to her and stuck his
head docilely under her arm like a young ox under the yoke.</p>
<p class="par">The women were all chattering hysterically. Suddenly the
Old Maid burst out oratorically to Julie. &ldquo;Dios! What are we to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what is happening?&rdquo; Julie demanded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have not heard? Christus!&rdquo; She flung up
her arms to heaven, while a piercing wail broke like a dirge through
the mango trees, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Los Macabebes! Los
Macabebes!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then Julie understood the meaning of the panic of
weeping. From the North was coming a band of those unique and
redoubtable little fighters, the Macabebe Scouts, of whose name every
other tribe in the Archipelago stood in awe. The Macabebes, for
centuries the friends of the white man and the enemies of all other
tribes. There was no forest retreat they could not ferret out and no
danger that they feared.</p>
<p class="par">In these far islands, they were a terrible legend. The
people feared them like the devil out of hell.</p>
<p class="par">The women continued to sob, and to repeat,
panic-stricken their dreadful monotone, &ldquo;Los Macabebes! Los
Macabebes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Old Maid commanded silence, and whirled upon Julie.
&ldquo;You must think of a way to help us, you who have gone to school
and have seen the earth. All <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>our men will be butchered. There
will be no sons, husbands or fathers left. The Macabebes are monsters
out of hell. They eat babies, and suck the blood of the dying. They
will make ashes of this island. There will not be one man left.
Dios!&rdquo;&mdash;she flung herself down on her knees, and the others
dropped with her, beating their breasts&mdash;&ldquo;if God made your
brain better than ours, save us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; demanded Julie
passionately. &ldquo;I have no power over such things? Has not the
Comandante held out to your men every opportunity to embrace order and
peace, and have they not scorned them all? Have they not preferred
rather to listen to the one malcontent who delights to sow discord
between the two races to which he belongs?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After this fearful piece of daring, she swept on:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t the Comandante promised you peace
and protection and a good government for all? And do not your men
continue to remain in the hills from which the Macabebes, for whom he
sent, will dislodge them at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; commanded the Old Maid.
&ldquo;Gather your children about you, and go down on your knees to the
Comandante, and don&rsquo;t rise till he promises to order back those
devils from the North. You, <i lang="es">Maestra</i>, will lead us and
speak for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie glanced about her impotently. This desperately
misguided swarm of women had put themselves into her hands. She was
terribly sorry for them, for after all they were only women who,
uninformed as to the motives of the men in the hills, had through weary
months held their families together. A thought struck her. Her face
lighted with some inner vision. She halted the female mob. Was it
possible to make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span>simple creatures like these revolutionary?
The women looked at her, and waited.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is useless to go to the Comandante
empty-handed,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;He is angry over the death of
his lieutenant. And many times your men have promised to lay down their
arms, only to break every time their promise. On this island no crops
are growing, no towns are flourishing. Those of you who have property
have had it seized by outlaws, and those of you who are poor must
continue to support alone your children, and to endure your anxiety as
well as the tax levied by Andegas upon every soul of you. It has all
grown worse and worse until you can not bear it any longer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The new government does not extort; it protects
the poorest among you. It will give you liberty, schools, the right to
accumulate property without fearing any man. It seeks to make you a
happy people, and the most enlightened in the East.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Make your choice between the two, you women.
Deliver to the men your ultimatum&mdash;that you have decided in favor
of government instead of anarchy. What! Cannot the women who, deserted
and unprotected, have borne the brunt of the war, take a stand alone?
Each one of you has power over one man who must himself already be
weary of hardship and separation. Rouse yourselves to act, for in this
way and in this way only can the Macabebes be kept away! Stop the war,
the outlawry, and the destruction of a beautiful island. Give your word
to the Major&mdash;the sworn word of the women of Nahal&mdash;that if
he will countermand his order for the Macabebes, the men will come in
and deliver up their arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Into the silence that surrounded her she continued to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>exhort. &ldquo;You, Marianna Tectos!&rdquo;
addressing the Old Maid, &ldquo;are rich and powerful. Many men will
listen to you, especially if you say that your purse will be closed
against them if they do not go over to the new government. You, even,
Nemecia Victoria who have power over many men, we ask you to help. And
Se&ntilde;ora Pandilig, tell your nephews you will disinherit them and
give your money to the government if they do not come around. Oh, you
all have your lever, if you are courageous enough to apply it. Do you
agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The women stood in thoughtful silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must defy our men for the government!&rdquo;
Se&ntilde;ora Pandilig exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To save them from the Macabebes!&rdquo; Nemecia
Victoria reminded. The dreaded name thrown into their thoughts with
this argument by one of their own number had deep effect. They stirred
and moved under the sun, and thought. An unaccustomed feat!</p>
<p class="par">Julie glancing over the crowd, reading the faces in this
moment of stress, held that each brown woman was weighing just how much
power she could personally, in an issue like this, exert.</p>
<p class="par">Comments ran down the lines: &ldquo;The men will be
angry!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They will be worse than angry, Mother of Jesus,
when the Macabebes tear out their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are we to do, Constancia?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you think, Celesta?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, it is beyond us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thus rippled their breathless fears and uncertainties. A
concourse of brown women facing a crucial decision which they could not
absolutely consummate, until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the Old Maid hurdled them across
with a leap. With a daring excitement that for an instant lifted her
above her world, she cried, &ldquo;We will tell the Comandante that we,
the women of Nahal, will undertake to bring in the men. We will go
before him now!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The procession started to surge forward, growing, as it
drew near Headquarters, more emotional at every step. Against this
collective femininity, Mike was powerless. It passed him in an
oblivious white heat, in an unassailable mood.</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden, whose office was in the <i lang=
"es">entresuelo</i>, stuck his crest against the grated bars of the
window and stared in stupefaction.</p>
<p class="par">Julie, bareheaded in the sun, her face reflecting
unnameable emotions towered aloft in the heart of the avalanche.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dear, dear! What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;
Calmiden demanded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Women! Oceans of &rsquo;em, overturning history!
We want to see the Major.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t overturn
anything here! He won&rsquo;t have it. Tell them to go home, and you
stay and talk to me, you exalted green-eyed person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Calmiden!&rdquo; roared the incensed Major from
the upper regions. Clearly he had perceived the onslaught from his
window, to which the worsted Mike had valiantly climbed for assistance.
&ldquo;What do you mean by letting all those women past the
door?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden looked at Julie in comic despair. &ldquo;Does
he expect me to wrestle individually with the feminine population of
the island? What are you all up to anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; yelled the Major, &ldquo;that I
refuse absolutely to see them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But the dogged remnant who had not yet succeeded in
getting inside the building merely continued to push. Masses of
agitated women driving up the stairs and sweeping along with them in
their advance a wondering lieutenant, an indignant sergeant-major, two
native clerks and an <span class="corr" id="xd21e1903" title=
"Source: intrepreter">interpreter</span>! A flood of women inundating
the furniture and bearing down on one solitary figure that still
withstood them. The Major, in impregnable dignity, sat fast in his
chair in rigid military fashion while the excited Mike, picking up
everything he could find, fired it upon the advance. Women
fundamentally annoyed the Major, and to have all the women in the world
surrounding him in an unescapable embrace was too dreadful to sustain.
He sat like Pharaoh in the midst of the visitation of the plagues,
sputtering under his breath.</p>
<p class="par">The routed office force stood helpless, while the room
rang with the classic wail of &ldquo;<i lang="es">Los Macabebes! Los
Macabebes</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Major addressed them. &ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; he
said to the interpreter, &ldquo;that for two years I have exhausted
every peaceful means to get the men of this island to return to their
homes. They take the oath of allegiance only to gain access to the town
and commit fresh atrocities. This is one of the last islands to
continue in a state of outlawry and disorder. The Macabebes shall
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden and the Sergeant-Major exchanged unofficial
glances of pure delight. A hush of sheer fright closed the
women&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You killed my Lieutenant,&rdquo; the Major
accused. &ldquo;Your men strangled him in the night when he was
defenselessly sleeping. You have bad leaders who inoculate you with
their passions. There have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>wicked deeds and murders.
These things must end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The women wept in terrible despair, helplessly wringing
their brown hands. Brown supplicating hands groping up out of the
dark!</p>
<p class="par">Julie, carried along by the throng, tried to speak. The
Major was right. Yet if Adams had lost his life, he had given
it&mdash;to the East. There could be no price set on blood so shed. The
vision rose before her of lonely Dao, and Adams guarding its destiny.
She wriggled forward through the women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;these women have
come to offer you a proposal of peace. If you will agree to delay the
coming of the Macabebes, they will promise to bring in their
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Major stared at her incredulously. &ldquo;The women!
What have they to do with the insurrection?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As things stand now, a great deal. There are only
women left in the villages now&mdash;without food. The burden of such
an existence has become too much for them to endure. They will no
longer furnish funds for Andegas. Maria Tectos and Nemecia Victoria are
rich women; so are the Se&ntilde;oras Calextas and Pandilig. The women
are the backbone of the community, and they give you their sacred
promise. They are weary of war, and wish to embrace the Government of
the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Major strode over to the window and turned his back
on them. The women stared tremulously at him&mdash;but Julie motioned
them back. He turned at last, frowning thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Maria Tectos!&rdquo; he said abruptly to the Old
Maid, &ldquo;Will you take the oath of allegiance? And you, Nemecia?
And the rest of you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I am a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are undertaking to make peace like a
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I swear before the High God?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That you will henceforth be a faithful adherent
of the Government of the United States. Put up your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria and Nemecia Victoria lifted trembling brown arms.
Dumbly the concourse followed their example. Julie alone understood the
valor of those uplifted arms. All these women were imperiling their
souls before the Padre for this terrible oath. But the Major had agreed
to hold back the Macabebes, and for that they could perform this
miracle.</p>
<p class="par">Calmiden watched Julie closely, as they went out
together.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You put them up to this. What was the
use?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If they do bring peace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Utopian dreamer! It will be the first time it has
happened that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I know these people a little. Maria will
leave no stone unturned. She did not need that perfectly valueless oath
that the Major imposed upon her to scare her into the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How can you be so interested in them?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is my destiny,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your destiny!&rdquo; He looked soberly at
her.</p>
<p class="par">There with the tropical sunlight beating down upon them,
they seemed suddenly to face their deeper selves. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie had received a note from Calmiden. &ldquo;We
will cross the causeway to-night,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p class="par">She waved back the toiling future generations of light,
and took the note to the window. What did it mean? The few lines
managed to convey a message quite beyond their import. She read them
over and over, then gazed across the white winding road and the green
banana trees, to the causeway lying like a high thoroughfare between
two worlds. Was to-day to be the last of an old existence, which she
was to shed like a discarded garment? Would the footsteps that had
followed strange paths in the East turn about completely, and the dream
that had burned in her soul be left forever unfulfilled?</p>
<p class="par">The breeze swayed the sacred tree of India beneath the
window, and its golden incense full of mystic and exhilarating
intimations showered upon the air. Julie was carried on the wave of its
magic to a roof garden in Manila and the hero who had first overwhelmed
the horizon of her youth. Often, looking out on this glowing landscape,
she had seen this image, but more and more as something lost in the
swift passage of life.</p>
<p class="par">She, would not see him any more. Fate, that fate which
ruled this world had arranged it so. Her destiny lay along the beaten
paths of the world. She was too small an atom, as Calmiden had said, to
survive the great chances of the coming upheaval, or to dare ever, ever
to achieve a force like Barry McChord&rsquo;s. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>His
spirit had lighted areas of her life tremendously. Nobody ever had so
stirred or quickened the pulse of her soul. But that spirit was
receding before the hard facts of existence that Nahal had brought. It
was getting too terribly hard, with so much pressing upon her, to
inhabit two spheres. And if anybody in the North had given her a
thought again, he had not taken the trouble to make it known. She had
dropped completely out of those great activities, and not a
reverberation of her life or its yearnings had reached the far-off goal
of her city of dreams. She herself shrinking to her real, insignificant
dimensions.</p>
<p class="par">The tangle of her affairs complicated all her thought,
and sent a chill wave over her. The cold, hard, insuperable fact of her
debts! She owed the merchants in Solano, the small merchants of her
village, and still, after the lapse of many months, she owed Mrs.
Morris a huge obligation. Finally, and very nearly the worst of all,
there was the desperate debt in which Purcell was involved. A pauper
and a gambler with life! How else could a person who had managed to put
herself in everybody&rsquo;s debt be called? Clearly she had
demonstrated that she could not handle her own life, to say nothing of
playing a part in that complex organization to which she had had the
assumption to aspire.</p>
<p class="par">A great agitation came over her when in that one solemn
final moment she looked into her soul and bade good-by to all she had
come to do. Slowly she began to efface and obliterate the old orders of
life, and the transcendent consecration of the past. The East to which
she had come with a torch became a mere drear fact of over-powering
millions. Ages, and the tried souls of many men would be offered up
before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>the East found its freedom. What she did or did
not do could not weigh in the infinite balance.</p>
<p class="par">Slowly she turned back to the room. The brown gnomes
were sweating terribly in the throes of composition, mining the realms
of thought for a few throttled ideas. Never anywhere were they so
dearly born. Julie stopped still to stare at them. &ldquo;Poor little
generation of light!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p class="par">Delphine glanced up at her with his quick brown eyes. He
was the barometer of the class&mdash;a youthful personality that had
escaped the general languor of the race. He watched the other boys, and
interpreted their needs. He seldom sat in his seat, but was, with his
books under his arm, almost always in a state of itinerant education.
He had been a devotee of the betel-nut, but at Julie&rsquo;s
solicitation had given it up.</p>
<p class="par">The children marched out at the end of the morning
session. Julie thrust her note in her pocket, and was following after
them when Delphine, trailing by a string a big bright red tropical
beetle, stopped her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You stay here always, <i lang="es">Maestra</i>?
You never go away?&rdquo; he urged earnestly.</p>
<p class="par">Julie glanced at him absently. &ldquo;Go home,
Delphine,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;is a present
for you of this beautiful bug&mdash;if you will not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, thank you, Delphine. I know it would break
your heart to give up Balthazar, though he bites nasty welts all over
you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But Delphine stuck along after her.</p>
<p class="par">A quickening of her being took place as she came out
into the street. After all, she was in the golden possession of life.
She picked some heavily fragrant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>flowers and thrust them in
her hair. She was young, and Calmiden was young.</p>
<p class="par">She moved along in the light like the heart of the
golden day, her shimmering head lifted to the perfume of the
Ylang-Ylang, and a hundred visions stirring in her brain. Behind her
unperceived, Delphine and the scarlet splendor of Balthazar desolately
trailed.</p>
<p class="par">In the evening she donned the green dress; but as she
slipped the green bracelet over her wrist, a sinister shadow swept for
a moment upon her mood.</p>
<p class="par">A lithe white figure appeared in the road. She went out
to meet it. She had never seen Calmiden when he was so beautifully
grave. She walked along beside him. Neither of them spoke.</p>
<p class="par">They went down to the beach, where leaving the village
behind they walked silently along the shore. The water washed darkly on
clean white sand with the beat and rhythm of a majestic poem of which
their emotions supplied the motive. They pressed on through the starlit
hush till the causeway lay directly before them.</p>
<p class="par">Wonderful lighted bridge! Water from great distances
bore up on either bank, and in mighty rushes took itself off again into
space. When the moonlight sprinkled through the darkness, this narrow
shining strip stood aloft over the fretted world.</p>
<p class="par">As they started to cross it, Julie said: &ldquo;I feel
as if I were suspended between heaven and earth! I hope I won&rsquo;t
drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They stopped short. With the turbulence of passion the
water was hurling darkly about them. The land appeared to be groups of
mystic shadows, and the stars were down almost within reach.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all said around me,&rdquo; Calmiden
declared in an unsteady voice. &ldquo;I have loved you from the first,
and I shall always love you. Nothing can change that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">An agitating vibration passed through Julie&rsquo;s
body. Was this the hour of fulfillment, toward which she had been
moving like a star?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Promise me,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;that you will
belong to me forever, that you will go with me out of this poisonous
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;of
course,&rdquo; speaking like one in a dream. &ldquo;Why, are you too
afraid that something might happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We could be married soon, and have done with all
fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie started perceptibly. Her thoughts had never
traveled that far. Marriage seemed vaguely a sort of risk to her
emotion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we go on for a while as we
are&mdash;till you are ordered away?&rdquo; she queried nervously.
&ldquo;It is so perfect as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But my existence is so uncertain! And why should
you continue to be flung around in this whirlpool? Some one should look
out for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because I am such a little fool that I
can&rsquo;t look out for myself? Oh, let us wait till the end of my
term. I came out here, you see, really to do something&mdash;and I am
so soon to drop it all!&rdquo; An unconscious anguish crept into her
voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe this country has put a spell upon you,
or you wouldn&rsquo;t be putting me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They were walking now along the causeway. The island
ahead of them lay like a sable mesh of mystery, with midnight archways
through its dense foliage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>Startling creepers, like multiform
arms of an unseen body, groped over the heart of the earth. A sad
fragrance floated out to them. Once or twice the moonlight making bold
with the forest lit up its stilly beautiful chambers.</p>
<p class="par">Julie made a sudden startled movement. &ldquo;There is
somebody over there! He is stirring along under the trees. He looks all
black. He is watching us! Come away!&rdquo; She dragged frantically at
Calmiden&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p class="par">He hesitated, his gaze strained into the darkness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that you are only one
man&mdash;with only one pistol? There may be a lot of men in
there.&rdquo; She pulled him back.</p>
<p class="par">He yielded at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you to look
out for,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p class="par">They ran swiftly back over the causeway, a target they
well knew for any one who might wish to shoot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was a fool to take you to such a place!&rdquo;
Calmiden exclaimed when they had reached the other end in safety.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am sure it was the priest!&rdquo; Julie panted.
&ldquo;Where rather than to that Eleusian island would that dark spirit
go? Those black trees just ached with the hatred of that Lucifer soul.
Over there, he plots to stir up discord among men. There on that ground
that he has made forbidding with supernatural tales he plans
insurrections.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wonder how many rifles he&rsquo;s got stored
away over there,&rdquo; Calmiden said.</p>
<p class="par">Then he sighed. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get across the
causeway, after all!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">From his upper state chambers, the Major was
beckoning to Julie with as much excitement as that statuesque
personality was capable of manifesting.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come up a minute,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I have
great news for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As Julie entered the room he greeted her with a smile
that thawed every line of his stony visage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The insurgents will surrender in Guindulman next
Thursday,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;They will deliver up their arms,
to a man, and will take the oath of allegiance! This might be called
the &lsquo;Peace of Women,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you think so? They have
carried the thing through. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, young lady,
those Macabebes would be down here right now. You belong to work like
this. The Island of Nahal ought to canonize you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie had never been so acutely stirred. After all, a
part of the Great Adventure was coming true!</p>
<p class="par">The natives of Nahal entered into a state of inordinate
rejoicing. On the evening before the memorable Thursday they gave a
ball of towering magnificence. It was true that at the ending of the
war almost every one was bankrupt, but nothing so spectacular had ever
happened in Nahal. It would be in the Manila papers&mdash;it would be
in the papers of America that the redoubtable Nahalites, of their own
free and enlightened will, had come to peace.</p>
<p class="par">Julie went to the ball with Calmiden, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>the fact that Purcell, in a formal note, had
claimed the privilege of escorting her. Julie had been cruelly
bewildered and apprehensive of the consequences of her refusal, because
the Treasurer was now the actual head of civil affairs.</p>
<p class="par">It was indeed a magnificent ball, but the Americans felt
considerable discomfiture upon finding their hosts still wearing arms,
when they had come unarmed.</p>
<p class="par">And a breach occurred between Julie and Calmiden,
because Julie accepted the Insurgent General&rsquo;s invitation to
dance. From Calmiden&rsquo;s point of view the request was the next
thing to an insult; but since this was the culmination of the <i lang=
"fr">coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> which she herself had instigated, the
fear of jeopardizing it in the slightest degree had her caught fast.
Not until the next day were the insurgents to give up their arms, and
in case Andegas became incensed, a little thing like a dance might
overthrow the whole course of destiny. It was perfectly possible for
Andegas to stick a knife in her back, as a signal for a general
slaughter. Moreover there was something in the perilous uncertainty of
the moment that exhilarated her. She had bent her soul upon a great
adventure, and she thrilled to the dim things it
foreshadowed&mdash;things that swam before her stirred vision like the
pageant of the worlds in the night sky which she glimpsed through the
galleries.</p>
<p class="par">When they left the ball, the Americans departing en
masse for mutual protection, Calmiden gave very clear expression to his
displeasure.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand you&mdash;the things you
do. What came over you to consent to dance with that half-breed?
Imagine their getting up a ball and coming bristling to the teeth with
weapons, just to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>tease us! That ought to be enough for you
forever! What makes you act as if you belonged to this hideous
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Julie under the fever of the night
recklessly replied. &ldquo;I understood this particular thing, and I
was going to see it through!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Even against my wishes? To dance with Malay
cut-throats&mdash;you a star!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I would have danced with the devil under the same
conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Julie, talk sense. However am I to understand
you? Chasing chimeras that will bring you nowhere&mdash;whereas you and
I are all that count. Give up these terrible notions. You don&rsquo;t
know what you are about&mdash;what, my God, all this may lead you
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They parted at Julie&rsquo;s door with a feeling of
estrangement, like the prick of pain.</p>
<p class="par">The next day Calmiden left for Solano, to secure some
supplies for the garrison. He went on a boat which had come into Nahal
harbor the night before, bringing mail.</p>
<p class="par">At school, Julie, who had not yet received her mail,
learned that salary checks had arrived for both James and Miss Hope. At
noon she hurried home, fluttering with anticipation and relief. The
thirty dollars was nearly all gone. At the thought of Purcell, she
shivered.</p>
<p class="par">With trembling fingers she opened her letters. One was
from Mrs. Calixter. She thrust it aside to hunt further for the check;
but her money had, inconceivably, not come. The disaster of the wrecked
boat had been rectified for everybody but her; all the others now had
their checks. What sinister design was back of this? Soon her desperate
situation would become <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>known, and against such publicity
her pride forcibly rebelled.</p>
<p class="par">She was facing a critical state of affairs. Although
certain varieties of food were cheap in the village, her resources
would soon be unequal to purchasing even these. She had been doing her
own cooking&mdash;very badly indeed; and suffering from it, as well as
from a too rigid economy of diet.</p>
<p class="par">Moreover the school, which was the center of her life,
was subtly, as under an evil enchantment, disintegrating. Every day
disclosed more and more empty benches, the youthful occupants of which,
in Julie&rsquo;s dreams, were to have been shining pillars of the
future. The girl&rsquo;s efforts to locate the cause of the
disaffection came up against a dead wall. The secret psychology of the
East confronted her. In vain, after facing those deserted benches that
struck like a blow at the very roots of her spirit, had she appealed to
the parents. The women were silently sympathetic, the men were
non-committal; but none reached out a hand to her.</p>
<p class="par">She guessed only too well whose power alone was great
enough to deflect the boys from their upward course. The souls of their
parents were throttled by their leader, at whose heels they would have
gone to the devil.</p>
<p class="par">The priest had learned who had instigated
peace&mdash;Maria Tectos having hung in the terrible limbo of
excommunication till full confession had been forthcoming. His
spiritual subjects had begun to show the disquieting effects of
revolutionary new thought, and he hastened to stretch out inexorable
arms over his dominion. A spiritual czar, whose whole power in life lay
in his compelling hold on the souls of men, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>he
did not intend that any of his chattels should escape their bonds. He
had an overweening sense of possession, but little real interest in his
creatures. Above everything conceivable, he hated the Americans. Since
he had laid his special curse upon Julie&rsquo;s establishment and had
not interfered with Miss Hope&rsquo;s school, it was perfectly clear
upon whom his ill-will was concentrated. With the vital structure of
her work shaking about her, she was in the worst possible straits.</p>
<p class="par">Her money, or rather Purcell&rsquo;s, had come to an
end. She was facing starvation. There was no one whom she could bring
herself to approach for help. She summoned her last forces of
resistance. Calmiden must certainly be back within a few days, and the
money from Manila could not diabolically hold away much longer.</p>
<p class="par">She picked up Mrs. Calixter&rsquo;s letter. It was full
of explanations of divers sorts, and threw light in multiple
directions&mdash;belated light.</p>
<p class="par">She and her husband had been to India on an extended
official visit with the Governor-General. She had meant to write sooner
to Julie, but on a trip like that, Julie would understand, a great many
things had been wiped out of mind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry McChord, whom you remember, I know, and who
still holds himself as your friend, told me on my return of his
fruitless efforts to find out what had become of you&mdash;and a very
strange mix-up it was. I was gone&mdash;and your Department gave your
location as Solano. But when Barry wrote there he received the answer,
after an unconscionable time, that there was no such person on duty
there. The Department, upon being again questioned, hazarded the theory
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>that you might have died or gone
home&mdash;although it admitted that of such events it should have a
record. At any rate you were given up for lost. What chaos
inconceivable! And that red-headed schemer&mdash;who I suspect was to
blame for all this&mdash;is still away on a long rest in Japan! I
believe that wretch has been deliberately miscarrying you on his lists
so that upon investigation he could point to his magnanimity in
assigning you to the superior station of Solano. If you would, brave
little Julie, insist upon going to the dangers of Nahal, he may have
argued, whatever happened to you should not be set down to his account.
If you wandered off any place else, it was not his fault. But how you
have received your salary I can&rsquo;t think unless he has made it his
own concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And was that why, Julie wondered, she was left in these
straits; and would be&mdash;until the red-headed man came back?</p>
<p class="par">She read on:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A little army woman whose husband is on leave
here from your very spot cleared up the mystery. She told Barry how
much alive you were&mdash;ending revolutions, and transforming the
Malay race; and being proposed to by the entire bachelor officer
personnel of the battalion&mdash;one of whom you were most certainly
going to accept.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry told me he could understand how you had
forgotten your earlier friends. I believe he is going to China, and
perhaps he will not come back. Each time he goes, he says he may not
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie put the letter down weakly. Ah, she was not at all
successful, as Mrs. Smith had said. Her school was almost
gone&mdash;and to-day she had had scarcely anything to eat.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When it was quite dark, she took a walk, staring into
the palely lit jungle as she passed. Overhead one brilliant
constellation blazed. It seemed to hang over a distant city far to the
north, beyond these troubled southern seas. She put out her arms to its
light. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A day came when Julie knew what it was to go
without food. She reasoned, in the midst of a bad headache, that she
was not the first person to whom this had happened, and that to go a
few days without eating was not absolutely menacing to one&rsquo;s
existence.</p>
<p class="par">The next day she unearthed a wrinkled <i lang=
"es">camote</i>, and Delphine presented her with a couple of <i lang=
"es">chicos</i>. Her giddy brain collapsed, however, over the
boys&rsquo; arithmetic, which suddenly had become as incomprehensible
to her as Euclid. On the third morning, she was wholly incapacitated,
and before the school hour, dropped down on a couch, where she dozed
off from sheer weakness.</p>
<p class="par">At ten o&rsquo;clock she heard as from a great distance
the whistle of the boat. Calmiden had come! She dragged herself up and
made an effort to dress, but she, strangely, felt no interest in a
world that seemed to have receded immeasurably out of her actual
experience. From tense struggle in its atmosphere, she had floated off
into sleepy planets where dreams were real. She tumbled back on the
couch and went to sleep.</p>
<p class="par">When she came back once more to mundane affairs, it was
about three o&rsquo;clock. Everything was still and lonely. Calmiden
had not yet appeared. He was always busy, though, for hours with the
unloading of the boat. Perhaps he had expected her to come down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>to the wharf to greet him, and she had been too
dazed to think of it. She dressed with closed eyes.</p>
<p class="par">A knock on the door startled her senses into activity.
She ran her fingers hurriedly through her deranged hair and opened the
door. Not Calmiden, but Dwight confronted her, looking greatly
perturbed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to talk to you&mdash;just a
bit&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie led him in.</p>
<p class="par">He dropped down on the bare edge of the chair that she
motioned to, and stared at her aghast. &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;you look like a ghost! Have you been ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie shook her head. &ldquo;What have you to tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was clearly at a difficulty to reply. Finally he
blurted out:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to me, Julie, and let
me help you&mdash;I&rsquo;d have been only too proud to do
so&mdash;instead of playing into the hands of that
blackguard?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie paled. &ldquo;Purcell!&rdquo; she murmured in
dismay.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Again she shook her head dumbly.</p>
<p class="par">Dwight pursed his lips in a solemn whistle. &ldquo;Gad!
Some folks would say it was none of my business, but I can&rsquo;t
stand by and see you facing the thing so pluckily and not lend a
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did Mr. Purcell do?&rdquo; Julie demanded
heavily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been taking his meals at the
bachelors&rsquo; mess lately&mdash;while he had no cook. To-day at the
lunch table he brought up your name, and he meant to do it to death.
But he was clever about it. He didn&rsquo;t want any one to stop him
before he&rsquo;d let out his powder. He began by saying that you were
engaged to Adams. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140"
name="pb140">140</a>]</span>You bet that made a stir&mdash;your being
engaged all the while you were letting the rest of us give you a rush!
Purcell said that he had seen Adams here in this town with you, that he
had made that fatal ride to see you, and that he himself had seen you
kiss Jack Adams good-by. Moreover, he declared, that when the anxiety
about Adams was at its height you informed the Major that Adams had
been in Guindulman and confessed your relation to him. That was a
stagger for us&mdash;all right, Julie, you&rsquo;ll admit. He said that
the Major himself had told him all this.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now several of us had liked you, Julie, ever so
much&mdash;and we got rather excited at your way of playing the game.
Purcell went on to say that you had had an affair with him, and with
Terry, who had also kissed you&mdash;along with Adams and others. Seems
he got the information about Terry from Miss Hope. He also said you
owed money to everybody, and that the firms in Solano had written
continuously to him about it. But when the creature, quite gone with
hatred and jealousy, said that you had borrowed money from him, and
that anybody could have you for a sweet-heart, I kicked him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Dwight had not dared to look at her during this recital.
Her head was bent down over her two clenched hands which lay in her
lap.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Kenneth was not there!&rdquo; she murmured,
illimitable satisfaction in her quivering voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But he <i>was</i> there!&rdquo; Dwight
cried&mdash;only to regret the next moment that he had spoken.</p>
<p class="par">Julie had shot up out of her chair and was gazing at him
with wide eyes of horror. As she stood there staring out of her ghastly
pale face, and not speaking, a sense of fear for her rose in Dwight.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I tell you, Julie, I&rsquo;ll stand by you
through everything!&rdquo; he vowed.</p>
<p class="par">She clutched hard at the back of the chair for support.
Her limbs were weak; her soul was shaken to its uttermost depths, but
she must still make a stand against this falling world.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I did borrow money,&rdquo; she said in a voice so
faint it seemed to trail after her thought like a thin curl of smoke,
&ldquo;not from Purcell, but from the Treasury, as I supposed. I was in
the direst need. None of us had received our salaries for months. I
hung out as long as I could, for I was afraid of him. But I was simply
driven to him at last. What a horrible net he has built around me!
Terry&mdash;himself&mdash;Adams, Ah! Yes, I did kiss Adams
good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Were there any witnesses present when he gave you
the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie shook her head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You poor, unsophisticated infant! Don&rsquo;t you
know that it would have been a criminal offense for him to use
government funds for his own purposes? You stepped right into his trap.
He was waiting for you, the rascal, and knew perfectly well that you
wouldn&rsquo;t know what you were doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, clearly, I have not at any time known what I
was about!&rdquo; She crumpled, stunned, into a chair.</p>
<p class="par">Dwight rushed to her. &ldquo;My God! Is it possible that
you&rsquo;ve been starving yourself with all of us right around to
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I guess I have&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t anything
compared to this. And who are all of you, who were ready to
help&mdash;as you say?&rdquo; the girl cried out in anguished
bitterness. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you all stand by and listen while that
man told his vile lies? You see now why I have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>no
more pupils in the school, why everything&rsquo;s gone to smash, and
I&rsquo;m hopelessly ruined, as he meant I should be?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be just to us, Julie! We were shocked at your
light treatment of Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, I was never engaged to Jack Adams. That was a
desperate, stupid lie of mine, which I hoped would help him out of the
scrape. As for the other men that I thought to be my friends&mdash;Oh!
this terrible land&mdash;where we&rsquo;re all strangers to one another
after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But this story must be put down. It&rsquo;s all
over the town. You can do that best yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The story of my own infamy&mdash;I must put
down!&rdquo; She laughed hysterically. &ldquo;You see, Dwightie,
it&rsquo;s so fun-ny&mdash;when I came offering all I had!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When the young man had left the house, Julie slipped
suddenly and insensibly to the floor.</p>
<p class="par">It was dusk when she thoroughly came to herself. Her
brain was clearer, and into it faintly crept the hope that Calmiden
might emerge successfully out of the catastrophe. Betrayal on his
part&mdash;however odious Purcell had sought to represent her&mdash;was
inconceivable.</p>
<p class="par">Dwight had dispatched a boy with a mountain of viands,
which she barely touched. She was not hungry. This was no time for
eating, when all the issues of her life were at stake. With a heart
that stopped beating at every foot-fall upon the road outside, she sat
unmoving among the shadows. Every minute must bring him to her need.
This day could not end in this monstrous state of affairs.</p>
<p class="par">But as dusk deepened into night and no sign of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>Calmiden appeared, a bitter frenzy of anger
stirred up in the wretched girl&rsquo;s heart. What kind of a man after
all was he who could stand by, without offering a protest, while her
enemies calumniated her? Here in her humbled pride and disgrace, she
was crouched waiting for a man who had so clearly repudiated her that
he did not even deign to proffer an explanation of his conduct. From
the affairs of this notorious nobody&mdash;her promiscuous love
affairs, and wholesale debts, he had contemptuously withdrawn himself.
Calmiden, she knew, had the conventional notions about the
impeccability of a woman&rsquo;s name. It was her whole duty, as he
expressed it, to keep it &ldquo;unsullied.&rdquo; He made sharp, very
sharp distinctions in his standards for the sexes. All women were
shooed into one corner of the universe, from which he dared them on the
direst penalties to emerge, while the men gamboled in the rest of its
wide areas in a fashion which he tolerantly chose to ignore. And all
the while he sincerely believed himself the broadest minded man on
earth. He had frequently crushed Julie in their arguments with his
towering Victorian morality. Julie had attributed what she considered
his charmingly archaic habit of mind to the fact that he had derived
his education at West Point, a sort of Military Monastery where women
were barred.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Calmiden had replied to this,
&ldquo;girls come up there in shoals!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you see them only on Dress Parade! What do
you know about them in their own environment, in the real phases of
life that stretch back of the Dress Parade?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was nice to have them come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! I think that that is just a little of what is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>the matter with you, Kenneth. You began your
life with <i>woman coming to you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie admitted, as she sat waiting for him, that she had
committed some intolerable foolishness. It was perfectly true that in
order to afford herself the thrill of conquest and satisfy at the same
time an errant poetic opulence in her nature, she had inconsiderately,
joyously and, as she had believed, inconsequentially, permitted most of
the men to make love to her. And that not singly but
simultaneously&mdash;and now she had been found out. Slowly began to
awaken in her mind the significance of every human act in the infinite
chain of cause and effect. Every one of these men had been humanly
piqued and curious. That, perhaps, accounted for their listening to
Purcell. Concerning Jack Adams, Julie felt her one justifying thrill.
Her comrade at arms!</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps she should have confessed this incident to
Calmiden, she thought, but she had never been able to bring herself to
speak of that adventure, now that Adams was &ldquo;out of it.&rdquo; It
seemed something sealed forever between him and her.</p>
<p class="par">Another hour passed and the girl&rsquo;s black
resentments and outraged pride rose into fresh tumult. The pride of the
Dreschells was their dominant trait. The world might hold
Calmiden&rsquo;s position in life better than hers, he might tower in
immeasurable contempt over the sordid disaster of her life, yet she had
one bomb left to deliver. She would drive him out of her life. He had
forced his way into it. The world might go hang! Purcell could make it
believe what he would. But upon one person the outrage to her dignity
and pride should be indelibly branded, so that never till the end of
his life would he be able to forget. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">His moment had come and passed&mdash;in the dark,
terrible hours, when frightened and half starved, she sat waiting for
him to come and set things right. Her brain had traveled the whole
blistered course of thought for extenuation, and now, roused to a fury
of injury, she determined to hurt Calmiden in the last way
possible&mdash;to cast him off finally and completely. That he had
already accomplished this repudiation beyond anything that lay in her
power goaded her to madness.</p>
<p class="par">In a suffocation of emotions she wrote the letter. It
was not what she said in the letter but the way she found to say it,
the white heat of the words, that must later have seared a path through
his brain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My vulgar debts repulsed you! The insinuations of
that man were pre&euml;minently revolting to your sense of pride. Not
to speak! It was an easy way out! There is another kind of Judas, it
seems! You sat and sold me away by your silence. You have done what I
did not dream it was possible for any living being to do. For such a
betrayal there can be no explanation ever. None is humanly
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She summoned Pablo Cherico from the other side of the
house, and told him to get Delphine, who lived not far away. The little
boy, roused out of his bed, came running. One person in this disheveled
world was always eager to serve her. She handed the letter to
Delphine.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take it at once to Teniente Calmiden, at the
Mess. Put it in his hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She stumbled back into the house, given over to the
demons of darkness and despair.</p>
<p class="par">When Julie awoke next morning, she found a bundle of
mail tied with a string, lying on her doorstep. There were two official
letters. Now when disaster <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>was quite complete and
irretrievable, her money had come&mdash;all the arrears of it. A week
ago and her life would have traveled into safe places. Now there was
nothing left but the bleak privilege of paying her debts.</p>
<p class="par">Delphine, with the captive Balthazar grubbing along in
the dust, appeared. &ldquo;I gave the letter into the hands of the
Teniente, last night, as you told me to do. He was already in bed. The
house is very ugly. No flowers on the table, no lace in the windows,
like in the beautiful residence of Mrs. Smeeth&mdash;nodding but
banjoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Julie cut in on him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nodding at all. <i lang="es">Maestra!</i> He take
the letter and read it, while I wait. Then he turn away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She turned heavily back into the house.</p>
<p class="par">Ignoring school&mdash;she had now been absent two
consecutive days from that depleted institution&mdash;she grimly
resolved to attend to her own concerns. Miss Hope, of course, would not
fail to take note of this defection, but Julie, bitter over the
careless methods of the Department which had helped to bring about this
d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, was reckless of consequences.</p>
<p class="par">First of all there was Purcell! She meant to tackle him
single-handed. Indeed there was no one that she could think of from
whom she could have derived support in this situation. If she had been
a man she might have knocked him down and settled the issue at once.
She wanted, she thought, to do something inexpressibly violent to
him.</p>
<p class="par">She was brushing out her hair before putting it up to go
out, when a shadow loomed in the doorway. There stood Nemecia Victoria
swaying like a purple passion flower. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Usually Nemecia was clothed in silken variations of the
spectrum, with cob-web laces across her bosom. To-day with a
winding-cloth bound round the body, her beautiful bronze limbs bared,
she looked like a statue.</p>
<p class="par">Nemecia crossed the room. She took the silvery coif of
Julie&rsquo;s hair in her hands and caressed it. &ldquo;My poor
Se&ntilde;orita, with hair like this, to live so meanly&mdash;at the
mercy of men!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">An acute curiosity shot through Julie. This was the
Nemecia who knew the secret hearts of men. Just whose secrets? A
temptation came to her to get Nemecia to speak. But no, she would not
lift that curtain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t live as I live?&rdquo; Julie
queried.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My mother did; she worked always,&rdquo; Nemecia
brooded. &ldquo;Her body grew to be all bones. Then she was stolen by
the Moros&mdash;to be a slave, till she died. When the pirates came I
hid in a hole in the ground. They took my brother too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her voice commenced to choke. She broke off harshly.
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;orita, have you heard the evil <i>that</i> man says of
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She lifted up her arms, beautiful soft arms, hardening
as they rose with a fury of passion that for the moment seemed to
eclipse the great golden calm of the morning world.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Men I have known many, but that white one is a
devil! I ha-a-te him, and since I am afraid Hell will not get
him&mdash;I shall kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">To Julie&rsquo;s <span class="corr" id="xd21e2338"
title="Source: dumfounded">dumbfounded</span> amazement she drew from
her bosom a long, thin, cruel strip of a blade and held it in her
clenched fist before her contorted face.</p>
<p class="par">Julie knew these people too well to be panic-stricken.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Put it away, Nemecia!&rdquo; she ordered.
&ldquo;They would put you in the calaboose and keep you there till you
died, an old, old woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nemecia&rsquo;s great eyes flashed fire. &ldquo;Are you
then cool over the things he said of you all over the village? Will you
allow him to insult you to the world, you who brought about peace for
Nahal? He seeks to ruin you, as he sought to torture me. Let me go for
us both,&rdquo; she whispered tensely, &ldquo;to-night, to the hammock
in the gallery&mdash;and when he sleeps&mdash;give two quick blows, one
for you and the other for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Alas, Nemecia, the calaboose is dark and cold. In
your little cell of stone by yourself forever, you would never see the
sun. You love the sun, Nemecia. You love the praise of your pretty
face. No one would ever listen to the music of your ear hoops again.
Just stillness and dark, forever, as if you had died and hung by your
hair in space!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she seized Nemecia&rsquo;s arm, and
the knife went clattering to the floor. Julie&rsquo;s eyes shone with
pleading. &ldquo;Do this for me, Nemecia! Let him go! Ah! What a
wonderful revenge! To hold the option of one&rsquo;s enemy&rsquo;s life
in one&rsquo;s hand&mdash;and to toss it back to him. Give me that
power, Nemecia! Give me that strength!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nemecia sulkily picked up the knife. Then she stood
erect facing Julie. &ldquo;My people owe you a debt which they have
forgotten. Take then as my share of it, this creature&rsquo;s life,
for,&rdquo;&mdash;in a fresh flare&mdash;&ldquo;I meant surely to kill
him this very night!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She turned indifferently out of the door.</p>
<p class="par">Julie waited till she was out of sight. &ldquo;I can go
to him now!&rdquo; she cried to herself. She started forth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>for
the Palacio. Fortunately it was an hour when there would be many people
in the building.</p>
<p class="par">There were two Filipino clerks in the office with
Purcell. Julie advanced, with head uplifted, to the desk where he sat.
He looked at her an instant and in the flash of his expression, Julie
saw how thoroughly he knew he had done his work.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to pay you back your
money!&rdquo; She handed him several checks. &ldquo;You will please
cash these. And you will give me a receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The note of calm authority in her tone clearly puzzled
him. He busied himself in a slight confusion with the safe.</p>
<p class="par">The transaction finished, Julie&rsquo;s spirits rose.
There were dangerous lights playing in her green eyes. &ldquo;You have
said some unspeakable things about me, things that you knew to be
utterly false! You are a liar, of course, and you believe me incapable
of defending myself. In this country too, where as you know,&rdquo; she
looked at him steadily, &ldquo;one can so cheaply buy one&rsquo;s
revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Purcell paled. She saw he had understood.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I did not expect my remarks to be repeated
broadcast. You did borrow money from me&mdash;and as you must be well
aware, the right sort of women do not resort to such
expedients.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl looked hard at him and at the thought he read
in her mind, a painful dark red dyed his face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who is to blame for all this?&rdquo; he exclaimed
in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;If you had taken me, I would have stuck to
you through thick and thin. I wouldn&rsquo;t have cast you off like
your friend Calmiden. He never intended to marry you. You must know
that. Didn&rsquo;t I warn you long ago?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you saw to it that your evil prophecies came
true. You have hurt me in every way possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She turned and started to go.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly she felt that he had pressed up behind her.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll still say it isn&rsquo;t too
late&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie wrenched herself out of his detaining grasp.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll&mdash; What will you do?&rdquo; she cried, turning
savagely on him. &ldquo;Having deliberately ruined the whole compass of
my life and brought to pass the worst that was humanly possible, you
still dare to think you have power over my life? Listen to me! I have
power over your life&mdash;at any moment. I held it on the tip of my
finger this morning, and balanced it there&mdash;and if you lift your
hand against me again&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped in a wild sob and ran
from the room.</p>
<p class="par">When she got to school, she found five boys huddled
together awaiting her, generaled thither by the faithful Delphine, who
had gathered them up outlaw fashion from the streets, and who was now
oratorically instructing them from the platform. Delphine announced to
her that the present gathering was the very best he could do,
for&mdash;though he had lain in wait for the former scholars from
dawn&mdash;they contrived to get down to the river, and from its
inaccessible depths had defied him, their heads bobbing along the
surface like grimacing corks.</p>
<p class="par">James, too, was furious and had been twice to see the
Padre, who had retreated to the sanctity of his lofty and impregnable
<i lang="es">convento</i> to avoid the emissary of education.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to climb the bell tower and beat
him,&rdquo; James declared in heat, &ldquo;if he doesn&rsquo;t call off
this boycott.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Purcell&rsquo;s rumors, monstrously exaggerated and
embroidered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>upon, had swept through the village. Public
opinion had pronounced judgment in these empty rooms. In desperation,
Julie went to the Major. He had heard the reports, and as he had a
particular sensibility for Julie, who had been the means of cutting the
Gordian Knot of his military career, he offered to give Purcell a piece
of his mind. It was an extremely delicate thing for him to undertake;
for, since Purcell was actually the chief civil functionary on the
island, it was the Major&rsquo;s duty to remain on good terms with
him.</p>
<p class="par">Julie found in these trying moments that she had
misjudged this man who towered in his rigid rectitude of character over
the life of the colony. He was stern military metal, but every atom of
that metal rang true.</p>
<p class="par">He assured Julie that the Americans understood the
unfortunate affair. The Filipino conception of it apparently did not
trouble his mind. The Padre to his deep regret was outside his
jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="par">The women of the colony defended Julie, as women if left
to themselves generally will defend their kind. One day when Julie was
passing Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s house, the little lady called out to her to
come in. After the girl had sunk dispiritedly into a cane chair, Mrs.
Smith broke out: &ldquo;Julie, you&rsquo;re taking this wretched
business too much to heart! Do you for one instant think that we who
know you would believe a thing against you? Marlborough was at the Mess
that day when all that trouble rose and heard what
passed&mdash;something about your having been engaged to Adams, and
your letting all the men kiss you. How many&rdquo;&mdash;turning into a
tone of playful curiosity&mdash;&ldquo;did, really? How fearfully
interesting, you little philanderer! I&mdash;there were a number in my
history too. Just heaps of &rsquo;em, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>fact. Why
shouldn&rsquo;t there be, when we&rsquo;re making the Sentimental
Journey of youth? These stupid men! They think they are the only ones
who can take the trip!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What made Calmiden mad, of course, was your being
engaged to Adams, his class-mate, all the time you let him make love to
you. That was playing the game rather roughly, I admit!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie explained wearily the embroilment about Adams.
&ldquo;He came down here because he was lonely&mdash;and to see me,
because, well, maybe I was a sort of romantic ideal to him&mdash;who
will ever know? We had made a contract to help each other
through&mdash;quite different, you understand, from the other kind of
contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does Calmiden know about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie listlessly shook her head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But perhaps that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s the
trouble! What would you have done if you thought he were untrue? He
has, moreover, a peculiar character, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Untrue? He is completely so!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What on earth has Calmiden done?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; Julie cried trembling.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your husband tell you the horrible things Purcell
said against me&mdash;my character, my integrity, shamelessly pulled
apart before the whole mess?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Purcell did not make any serious attack upon your
character while my husband was present. He spoke, as I have said, of
your engagement to Adams, and of the fact that he had seen Adams kiss
you&mdash;and some others, I believe. What he said afterwards,
Marlborough did not hear, for, not finding the conversation to his
taste, he got up and left, and so did Calmiden!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Kenneth?&rdquo; Julie cried wildly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, he left the room, Marlborough said, white
with rage. He was furious at your double play.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But Dwight said that Kenneth was there&mdash;and
took no part.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who was following anybody&rsquo;s movements after
such a disclosure? Don&rsquo;t you see, nobody had dreamed that Adams
had come to Guindulman! And when you know Dwightie as well as I do,
you&rsquo;ll discover that he never sees anything clearly, poor dear,
when he gets excited. Marlborough says that when Purcell announced that
the Major had told him that you were engaged to Jack Adams and that
that was why he set out on his disastrous adventure, everything was in
excitement, and Calmiden rose straight off and left. Perhaps he should
have said something when Purcell spoke of your universal
flirting&mdash;he made a mistake there, but he was shocked and
angry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ve handed you back a new lease of
life, I see. Go immediately and make your peace with Kenneth.
Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie never knew how she got across the parade ground;
it seemed as if on wings. The blood was spinning in her head. Once home
she sat down and composed a letter, of a kind that never in all her
life was she able to write again. It was written under the spur of
renewed belief in the universe. Until this wrong was righted the
universe could not properly balance, and not an instant must be lost in
setting it right.</p>
<p class="par">In this letter, Julie endeavored to make Calmiden
understand that there was nothing she would not do to show how
fearfully sorry she was.</p>
<p class="par">She made a full and free explanation concerning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>Adams. Very urgently she tried to initiate
Calmiden into the delicately intangible bond that had existed between
them. She explained that the disastrous first letter had been written
in one of her fatally uncontrollable impulses, prompted by
circumstances which at the time had distorted her view. She would
reveal those conditions when he came to her, which she begged him to do
at once.</p>
<p class="par">Nothing could have been more consummately abject than
this letter. Julia again dispatched Delphine to Calmiden, with the
strictest injunctions for a swift return with the answer.</p>
<p class="par">At last the swift soft pad of Delphine&rsquo;s feet in
the dust of the road! Then in another moment, breathing hard, for he
had sensed the super-importance of the errand and had flown through the
streets, the lad laid the envelope in her hand. Her name was inscribed
on it in Calmiden&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p class="par">Julie tore it open. Short, like a telegram, it burned
through her brain. &ldquo;I can not come, now. Sometime you will hear
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">That was all. A masterpiece of the enigmatic, meaning
anything or nothing at all. Julie sat down and studied it out for a
shred of hope or help it might contain; but at last, with tears of
loneliness and despair in her throat, she gave it up. Calmiden did not
mean to come back. Of that she was now convinced. She had injured him,
and he had told her over and over with unmistakable directness that he
did not forgive. From him this answer was inevitable. There was no
appeal from it. Not even her letter had weighed in the issue.</p>
<p class="par">Time went mercilessly on. The term was drawing towards
its end. There were now only two pupils <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>left in her once
ardently conceived shrine of uplift. One of these was of course
Delphine&mdash;the other an undersized youth who found it completely
impossible to escape him.</p>
<p class="par">She wondered how she had managed to be so happy once; or
so independent in her aims. Those aims had now become almost obscured.
One can&rsquo;t go on greatly believing when the edifices one has
sought to raise to the gods are smitten by lightning. Julie&rsquo;s
once fervid spirit was becoming becalmed. She couldn&rsquo;t understand
anything at all&mdash;a dark veil seemed to be stretched before her
eyes. She longed, and yet dreaded to get off the stage of this
drama.</p>
<p class="par">The bachelors had moved their establishment down the
hill, to the very house that Julie upon her introduction to Nahal had
occupied. The Plaza had become too congested, and the Reyes had rented
their house to the Military Government. Julie did not see Calmiden; he
contrived absolutely to keep out of her way.</p>
<p class="par">Finally they passed each other one day on the street.
Julie turned white, and a spasm crossed Calmiden&rsquo;s grim, gray
face. As their eyes met, her blood congealed. For out of this brooding
face nothing of the old Kenneth looked. One hard passion had conquered
that face and turned it to stone. Right there the truth that she had
paradoxically refused to receive stared her in the eyes.</p>
<p class="par">He did not speak, and neither did she. A ghastly
encounter&mdash;the meeting of their dead selves! Frightened and
hopeless, Julie hurried on when she saw that Calmiden was to make no
sign. He had closed definitely his strange soul.</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s reason was beginning to point out
inexorably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>that Calmiden was a great deal more to blame
than she had thought. The questionableness of his permitting Purcell to
say in his presence anything whatever about her&mdash;however
shattering to his personal romance, or of his allowing his anger and
outraged pride to get the better of him before he had demanded an
explanation of her, had not at all balanced, in his mind, the fact that
in her blistering letter she had told him that he was the worst
possible conception of a cad. She knew that Calmiden had sought out the
Treasurer, and that they had fought brutally in Purcell&rsquo;s
quarters; but even there he had accorded her enemy, however violently,
the chance for a vindication that he would not give her. Also she knew
that, although he had fought her accuser, belatedly, he still believed
secretly a great deal of what that accuser had had to say.</p>
<p class="par">He had caused her to suffer a great deal. He had
brutally broken her pride, and had done it wilfully, hoping to make her
contemptible to herself. It came over her in a great moment of proud
anger and relief that she had never actually cared for him. He had
succeeded in swerving her out of her path, he had quenched her torch,
and helped to place her in the failure where she now found herself. Her
soul, for a long time to come, would scorch with the hurts he and Nahal
had inflicted.</p>
<p class="par">In the bitter days that followed, the girl felt
hideously lonely and abandoned. A sense of disgrace scorched her
isolation. People believed wicked, abominable things of her, and there
was no way to change their minds. The friend upon whose loyalty she had
most depended had under the severest conditions deserted. She cried a
great deal at night, till one day a letter came that brought a rebound.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=

<p class="par">For a minute or two it seemed hard to believe the
reality of this message. It read:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Your friends, the Calixters, have left the
Islands. He was offered something better at home, and her health had

<p class="par">&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t have time to write you, but she
did tell me what those people down there were trying to do to you. It
is not my custom ever to stand by and see my friends hurt.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Father Hull and I are arranging your transfer to
Manila. I beg you not to remain an hour longer in that awful spot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Father Hull will meet you when you come

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Would he indeed come back!&rdquo; Julie recalled
what Mrs. Calixter had said: &ldquo;Each time he goes he says he may
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There was another letter from Manila&mdash;from Isabel
Armistead:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;I saw the Calixters before they sailed.
They said you were about to come north, out of your hermit wilds; and

better fortune than you have ever found before.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=

<p class="par">The time came for Julie to put in her application for
transportation to Solano, where she would catch a boat for Manila.
Calmiden being Quartermaster, her application passed through his hands,
and came back to her signed by him. She stared grimly at his
signature.</p>
<p class="par">That same afternoon she met Mrs. Smith on a corner.
&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; that lady exclaimed. &ldquo;The
Treasurer has been dismissed, and is ordered to turn over his office
and leave at once. Julie,&rdquo; she asked whimsically, &ldquo;where is
your pull?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie shrugged her shoulders negatively.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think? How about that man in
Manila who was so glad to hear about you again? Couldn&rsquo;t he do
almost anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s eyes opened. She had written to Mrs.
Calixter and recounted her troubles. Could that have been what Barry
meant?</p>
<p class="par">On that last day when she stood in the school which had
once been the temple of her faith, one solitary boy faced her,
struggling with his tears&mdash;the loyal Delphine.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Maestra</i>, take me with
you!&rdquo; he chokingly pleaded, clinging to her skirts in appeal. The
girl and the little brown boy clung to each other weeping.</p>
<p class="par">After leaving the school, she went to a spot outside the
village and gathered some flowers. She had made few farewells, but
there was one person to whom she must bid a positive good-by. It was a
shining morning. On just such a one had she embarked upon the
renaissance of Nahal.</p>
<p class="par">The cemetery, as she entered it, was very still. Nobody
ever appeared to visit it, yet Adams&rsquo;s grave had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>a
fresh look that startled Julie. It was as if he had not completely
given up his hold on life; as if he were vaguely in part still present.
Somewhere down there she might reach the heart of a friend&mdash;a
friend who had passed through the limits of human tragedy.</p>
<p class="par">It was the kiss he had given her that had really put her
disaster in motion; but it rose at this moment before her as the
cementing seal of a friendship of high deeds.</p>
<p class="par">For a long time Julie sat over the grave, insensible to
everything but this sad communion. The sun, merciless creator, flung
upon the world the compulsion of his quickening rays, ruthlessly
enforcing the fiat of life. All the burning force of existence seemed
to be beating down upon her bared head like an intolerable weight; but
she heeded it not. To be human, and to be the plaything of unassailable
forces; to aspire, and to be defeated; to reach up like Prometheus for
the fire of Heaven, only to be dashed to pieces on the ground! In a
paroxysm, Julie flung her head down upon the grave. There was nothing
in the universe to answer anything!</p>
<p class="par">When she lifted herself up a queer numbness had attacked
her limbs. Forked lightning seemed to be piercing her brain. Holding to
her head, as if there were a rift in it, she staggered out of the
cemetery. She was in the acutest pain. But beneath it, conquering each
convulsion was the indomitable resolve to leave Nahal. To-day she
should go out of this island forever!</p>
<p class="par">From the wharf a row boat was to take her to the steamer
out in the bay. The vessel was to leave at two o&rsquo;clock, the
siesta hour. The Major, with Mike <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>scuffling along behind on a
chain like an imp, escorted her to the wharf. Almost blinded she got
down the hill.</p>
<p class="par">The Major seemed to be much moved, and unable to find
words that would put his feeling into expression. &ldquo;It will be a
long time hence perhaps before you will reap any reward for what
you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I myself am under an undying
obligation to you, and while my appreciation is not much&mdash;&rdquo;
he stopped, and studied her face. &ldquo;Go home, my child,&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the East crucify you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie shook the hand of the fine old soldier, and walked
down the wharf. There, a brand new camisa on his back, and the smallest
conceivable bundle in his hand, was Delphine.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I go with you,&rdquo; he announced in a transport
of determination. &ldquo;My oncle&mdash;he give me away, with the new
shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Even Balthazar was not missing! With his halter around
his neck, he was hanging investigatorily over the wharf by what
appeared to be the nub of his tail.</p>
<p class="par">Delphine thrust into Julie&rsquo;s hand a crumpled sheet
of paper written over in very bad Spanish, and signed unmistakably by
Pedro Bebong. In this document he ceded over the body and soul of one
Delphine.</p>
<p class="par">The children of the East&mdash;bartered, sold, drowned
by guardians who were unable to cope with existence! Julie&rsquo;s
heart had often ached over the valuelessness of their poor little
lives. It was for all these poor crushed creatures that she had come
overseas to offer her life.</p>
<p class="par">But she was having much too desperate a time making her
own way through this new world to become responsible for another
creature. Besides, she had had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>one wormwood lesson in
adoption. She gently shook her head.</p>
<p class="par">The boy began to cry wildly, in an abandonment of
despair. The tears ran down the quaint little corsair face. The poor
little starched <i lang="es">camisa</i>, which had stuck out stiffly
like armor in which to encounter the world, fell limp under the rain.
Even the little bare feet had their appeal. They were willing to trudge
the world over to find a future.</p>
<p class="par">The Fiscal came down to the wharf on <span class="corr"
id="xd21e2563" title="Source: busineses">business</span>. Delphine
appealed his case to him, crying and clinging to his coat. The Fiscal
said that the note transferring Delphine was perfectly genuine and
authentic; that the boy&rsquo;s aunt and uncle found great difficulty
in feeding their own brood, and that if the boy did not go with the
Maestra, he would be apprenticed to a Chinaman who kept a tin-shop.</p>
<p class="par">Into that den of filth and idolatry would go everything
that Julie had planted in the best of her boys. Did Delphine,
frantically pleading, dancing about in his grotesque little <i lang=
"es">camisa</i>, and weeping terribly all over his droll face, dream
anywhere in him of saving any of those things?</p>
<p class="par">Julie stood silent. Balthazar, emerging from under the
side of the wharf, scrambled towards her, and gave angry pecks at her
shoe.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The boy is dissatisfied with Nahal,&rdquo; the
Fiscal said. &ldquo;Now that the yeast is in him, he wishes to rise. I
was that way once; but a man, as you know, Maestra, cannot push through
a wall. Take him, if you can. Do not leave his soul to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie gazed at the boy clutching now at her skirts. As
she gazed down into his face, the revelation came to her. Down there
before her, electing to follow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>her wherever she went, the
new generation knelt. Whatever the past and the East stood for, the new
generation had cast the ballot for her and the light. Defeat was turned
into victory&mdash;a victory that would grow and become universal. In
the face pleading up at her, she saw the curtain of darkness rent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, Delphine!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">From the deck she watched the island recede, beautiful
and paradisiac as it had first looked. The scent of its golden flowers
drifted out upon the water. Quiet, green, and sun-touched, the island
drifted off like a dream. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie was entering again the Arabian Nights&rsquo;
city. It lay emblazoned in the light of a blood red torrid sun fast
sinking behind a towering mountain that uprose out of wide stretching
plains already shadowy under the first sprinkling of dusk. Through the
streets of the City, the many races of the earth were moving in slow
crooked currents. Back in the charmed City to stay! Back in the midst
of the Empire-builders and the destiny of the enigmatic East!</p>
<p class="par">Julie expected to go to one of the hostelries of the
City. There were a number of them, of which the Oriente was by far the
best known and most brilliant. It harbored under its palmy roof people
from all corners of the world, and was the stage for a great deal of
the drama of the East. There were Australians and New Zealanders, come
up to see what the Americans were making of things and to have a bit of
fun nearer than Europe; Hindoo rajahs with their trains, who had
unaccountably found their way here; Chinese and Japanese officials
bound, in silence, on their inconjectural errands. Manila was
glitteringly cosmopolitan. It was just now attracting the eye of all
the East, and picturesque people coursed in and out of it like a
strange spice. Almost all of this throng found refuge in the Oriente.
Not foreigners alone made lively this resort. There was the
City&rsquo;s own strange population; and exiles from the <i lang=
"es">bosque</i> were there seeking nepenthe for their souls in the
dancing and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>music of its plaza, in its life and love. No old
colonial of to-day can pass the still gates of this closed pavilion of
pleasure without a pang for the vivid era of the past.</p>
<p class="par">But this glittering khan Julie would be forced to pass
by. Aside from the prices, high in those prodigal days of the Empire,
the great hostelry, while respectable, held a much too vivid
representation of Anglo-Asian life for a solitary girl.</p>
<p class="par">The ship was wharfing. Julie perceived a conspicuous
equipage waiting on the pier. Beside its white-liveried coachman sat an
unbelievably small figure which was turning its strange miniature
individuality about on the box. Isabel&rsquo;s queer dwarf! He must
have seen Julie, for in an instant he was burrowing his way through the
travelers. Soon he was standing before her, extending a letter and
nodding his uncanny little face up at her.</p>
<p class="par">The note was from Isabel. She had written it just before
setting out on some enterprise, and as she had intimated before would
not be at home to receive Julie; but she had made all arrangements for
Julie to remain in her house.</p>
<p class="par">The dwarf gesticulated towards the carriage with one of
his elfin hands. Delphine looking about him at all the wonder uttered
an exclamation. The dwarf, glancing at him quickly, spoke to him in the
same dialect. They began to chatter to each other.</p>
<p class="par">The mannikin, Delphine excitedly informed Julie, had
been born on the Island of Nahal.</p>
<p class="par">The village of Guindulman&mdash;did they know it? the
dwarf asked. Julie told him that she had lived there for some time. It
was from there that he had been stolen as a child, and made a slave.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Guindulman remained as a bright spot in his memory; his
little nut of a face transformed under the glow of reminiscences.</p>
<p class="par">He and his mother and his sister had all been scattered
in the raid of a band of Moros, and he had never seen either of them
again.</p>
<p class="par">A recollection seized on Julie. &ldquo;What was your
sister&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nemecia Victoria&mdash;she was a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Delphine joyously put in, &ldquo;she
is there now&mdash;a pretty lady; and very rich&mdash;with so many
friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie gave Delphine an arresting look.</p>
<p class="par">The dwarf trembled a little. &ldquo;My sister is
alive!&mdash;and well off!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Julie replied. To her relief, he did
not ask any more questions.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Will you then go back to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The dwarf turned away. &ldquo;What is to be, will be. I
have been everywhere with my mistress&mdash;even to England. I will not
leave&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="par">Julie drew Delphine aside, and cautioned him what he
should say of Nemecia. Delphine listened attentively under the shadow
of a dreadfully civilized little derby hat, which had evidently
accompanied the new camisa, and demanded permission to tell his new
friend of the Peace that had come about in Nahal and of the part his
Maestra and Nemecia had played in it.</p>
<p class="par">Julie sat back comfortably in the carriage, with a
feeling of gratitude toward Isabel. The hotels other than the Oriente
were neither good nor picturesque, and from one of these Isabel had
saved her. Her reflections were cut short by the sight of an urgent
face making its way toward her through the crowd&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>though it was not until a black habit appeared
in conjunction with the face that Julie recognized the painfully
emaciated features of Father Hull.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m late!&rdquo; he exclaimed, extending
his hand to her, and taking in the carriage with a dissatisfied glance.
&ldquo;They misinformed me at the steamship office as to the arrival of
the boat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I had a <i lang="es">carromata</i> waiting for
you,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I have also made arrangements with
some Spanish-Mestizo friends of mine for your lodging. Suitable
accommodations are always hard to procure in Manila, and I strongly
advise you to take advantage of this opportunity&mdash;especially as it
is in the district to which you will probably be assigned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; he added, knitting his
brows at the carriage, &ldquo;the Reredos are not immediately
prepared&mdash;and an unprepared Spaniard is a serious thing. One
cannot walk in and out of their households after the fashion we have at
home. They lack the quality of casualness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the meantime, I know of a very good hotel
where you can pass a few days at a very reasonable rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie informed him that the carriage she was in belonged
to Mrs. Armistead, a friend of hers, who had invited her to remain in
her house till its owner returned from a trip. She believed it would be
ungracious not to accept the hospitality offered. Part of her baggage,
moreover, was installed in the carriage, and arrangements made for the
rest of it. Privately Julie had no desire to go to a cheap hotel when a
chance at that wonderful house was offered.</p>
<p class="par">The priest appeared to consider, in troubled thought.
Rather reluctantly, Julie thought, he consented to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>arrangement. He said he would communicate later
with her concerning the school. Then he lifted his hat and moved
away.</p>
<p class="par">Julie had wanted to ask him about Barry, but had not
found the opportunity.</p>
<p class="par">As the carriage drove away, the dwarf and
Delphine&mdash;who was clutching Balthazar, too stupefied from the trip
to be troublesome&mdash;sat close together, talking rapidly. The dwarf
occasionally stole a shyly appreciative glance at Julie.</p>
<p class="par">Julie passed across the city, coursing through its dusky
streets, in a mood of subtle excitement. Everywhere she was met by the
Change! Not a change that assailed the physical senses, but one that
transcended them: a subtle, widespread intimation that quivered on some
inner receptivity. Not the altered streets, the new buildings, the
material renovation, gave it forth so much as the peculiar quickening
of the atmosphere through which the soul of these people seemed to
suspire. How can one trace the leaven in the bread or follow through
the far filaments of thought a psychic metamorphosis? Yet there it was.
The very stones of the pavement proclaimed it. The Resurrection was
stirring through the worn kingdoms of men, and the blood of the
Builders coursed beneath it all like the rivers of life!</p>
<p class="par">Every moment Julie thrilled deeply to what she saw. The
Builders were beginning to fulfil. Here in this single corner the
stagnant spirit of the East was awaking to life. Wars might be fought
in the future, and races degraded and aggrandized, but the spreading
influences of this endeavor would reach far into the future of men.</p>
<p class="par">Again she found herself in that perfumed garden
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>before the sweep of Babylonian pillars with the
shimmering palace lifting like a jeweled Taj Mahal out of the mystery
of the thick, soft night&mdash;and the giant trees and scented shadows,
and the bamboo chanting to the forthcoming stars. The mansion of the
Caliph!</p>
<p class="par">She stepped softly up the flights of stairs into the
great lengths of chambers, glowing under dim lights with the rich
acquisitions of strange lands. The house was all sheer beauty,
exquisitely compiled. The river came up to the verdant banks on its
rear. Mystical, shadow-banked, it set the senses quivering. The
surroundings stirred Julie like the confused beauty of Eastern music,
and brought up dim, poetic suggestions of Queens of Sheba and
Scheherezades and the unending dynasties of kings&mdash;of the poetry
and the romance of old, unchanging things.</p>
<p class="par">She ate her dinner, a solitary figure, at a huge banquet
table of shining <i>nara</i> set forth with Indian silver, delicately
carved with the loves and conquests of maharajahs and goddesses. After
dinner, she wandered about fascinated. What a triumph Isabel had made
of the house. What a marvelous woman, indeed, she was!</p>
<p class="par">She stopped short in a chamber of shining carvings, slow
wrought wonders of a land where hands were cheaper than tools, and life
was the cheapest of all. From the midst of the labor of these unvalued
hands, she caught the glimmer of a strange little figure with bent
head, shining stilly out of the dusk. The Green God! Beautiful,
terrible, Lord of the Eastern universe&mdash;to whom myriads of souls
were fastened in supreme faith. With what awful power he was invested
by their belief! She had walked upon him unawares, and now hurried to
get away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As she emerged disquieted into the main sala, a head
thrust itself softly, like a projected shadow, above the old Spanish
balustrade of the stairs. The body did not appear and the head paused
only long enough to startle Julie. A dark, aged human vision. In the
fleeting look she could not tell whether it was the face of a man or a
woman; but there had been a flash from the depths of that being that
had frightened the girl. It was gone, and she calmed again. After all,
in the East, all sorts of unexpected faces peer at one from odd
corners.</p>
<p class="par">Later Julie tried to question the dwarf. Who was the old
being she had seen? Did it pop in and out of people&rsquo;s houses at
will? Did his Mistress know anything about her? Dicky-Dicky, the dwarf,
looked at her with inscrutable eyes, and knew nothing. Julie decided to
say no more about it.</p>
<p class="par">The next day Isabel appeared. Vividly beautiful like
some bright houri, she came smiling to the gallery where Julie was
sitting. &ldquo;I am happy to see that you have found your way back to
us!&rdquo; She kissed Julie with her perfumed lips. Then she stood back
and regarded her. &ldquo;Ah, my poor little friend, you have changed! A
hard time is written all over you, and you are too thin for your
clothes. Poor little dust-covered Atlas! Tell me about it. I love all
brave journeys. But first we will have lunch. I am starved. I have had
a long trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From your letter, I thought you would be gone
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have been off on a secret glorious errand to a
place of which you shall never dream. You would have to have the East
in you for that. I have been building paradise to suit myself, bit by
bit. The kind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>of paradise you think of is made for every one,
for all sorts of people you couldn&rsquo;t get along with on
earth&mdash;so why, I ask, repeat the experiment in the courts of
God?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor is paradise for one alone, my friend. It is
for the comrades of our souls, scattered sometimes as far as the ends
of the rainbow. There are a few golden beings that in some eternal
citadel we should hold fast. Do you think&mdash;&rdquo; she exclaimed
suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;that if I climbed to the arch of Heaven by my
nails I could capture the one great friend of my soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her tone changed. &ldquo;I came back. I hungered for
Manila. It holds the world for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is Scheherezade&rsquo;s city&mdash;full of
wonderful adventures!&rdquo; Julie declared with shining eyes. &ldquo;I
wonder,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;what it holds for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They seated themselves at the table before golden iced
mangoes. The huge silver bowl in the center was loaded with great
scarlet blossoms whose perfume saturated the Air. They seemed to faint
under their own fragrance, for Julie observed that while dewily fresh
at the commencement of the meal, they were all but dead at the
close.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing here lives an hour after you pick
it,&rdquo; Isabel dissatisfiedly remarked. &ldquo;But the quick new
buds replace the blossoms almost in a breath. I am glad I have no
children, to crowd me out. I like the flowers of Europe. You can wear
them all day and then keep them on in water. Life is longer over there.
Here we have only our hour. But such an hour! Take you and me at
thirty-five! You will be young&mdash;a cold storage sort of
youth&mdash;and I, well, it is written in the stars and the heart of
the Green God where I shall be&mdash;but I shall have lived,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>oh, very splendidly little Atlas, while you will
only have drawn breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After luncheon she put on a n&eacute;glig&eacute; of
lustrous silk and flung herself on a couch, her splendid black Malay
hair loosened about her, a cigarette in her lips.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is a water carnival at the Palace to-morrow
night, and the question of your costume must be settled at once. It is
late, and all the tailors are over-crowded with orders. I am afraid too
that I may not be able to get you into a boat. I might take you in my
float, but that would necessitate darkening you up, and it would not do
to obscure your little ray of light.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You might be gotten up as Saturn, with filmy
rings. But the nebul&aelig; would prevent you from dancing. I have it!
You shall be a Pleiad. I have seen a picture of them leaning over the
edge of the world, out of the mists of the sky, and you look like that!
You can be a Pleiad quite conveniently, too, with folds of moonlight
mist, some sandals, and a star. It only involves buying a roll of gauze
from an East Indian. I have a star among my things, and we can find
some sandals.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; she urged, laying lightly
compelling fingers on Julie&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;tell me about it! Tell
me everything that took place down there&mdash;and afterwards, forget
it forever. There are no memories in Scheherezade&rsquo;s
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This was Julie&rsquo;s first opportunity to unburden her
soul, and she was still surcharged with what had happened. Some one
else might be able to understand; some one else might be able to make
things clear. So under the stimulus of Isabel&rsquo;s fragrant liqueur
her innermost amazements and hurts burst into speech.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel&rsquo;s blue eyes lost their dreamy expression,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>came acutely awake, her cigarette burned
unheeded, while Julie&rsquo;s sorrows, perplexities, and final
confoundment of soul passed in array before her. When the girl had
finished and had sunk back into the old stupid <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2717" title="Source: questioninng">questioning</span> wonder,
Isabel exclaimed:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Great is the Green God! Never say he is not kind.
Surely he led you out of it. Don&rsquo;t regret the stone image that
let you starve under its eyes! There was more to come, little Atlas.
You have something different in you&mdash;something very nearly divine.
I feel it at my finger&rsquo;s ends; though I don&rsquo;t want it to
come any nearer than that poetical distance. It is bringing you some
place, and it was not meant that your destiny should halt where you
perhaps believe it should. I am a prophet, you see. If I were not
Empress of the East, as they say, I should travel as a prophetess
through the land&mdash;like my mother. You have heard of her&mdash;how
she gave up her wealth to wander and foretell? She too dreams of the
Victorious East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie regarded this magnificence of mood with wonder.
All manner of men, it was said, had loved Isabel; and in some peculiar
way their lives had seemed to be bound up in her colorful
personality&mdash;as if her sphinx-like spirit had devoured and
assimilated their souls. Her mood was always an extravagant expectation
of more than could be reasonably aspired to by any one person.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, what do you know about men?&rdquo; Isabel
suddenly exclaimed. &ldquo;To hear you is like listening to the
forgotten primer of one&rsquo;s childhood. Nevertheless, there was long
ago just such another as yourself, one as piteously credulous and
blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly an alien Isabel rose before the girl, an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>apparition of which the suppressed terribleness
frightened her as if some strange ph&oelig;nix had risen from its ashes
before her eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have told me your story. Now I shall tell you
one of mine&mdash;a buried story of my old, old self. There are perhaps
many turns yet in the course, but long after I shall have forgotten
everything else, this one memory somehow shall remain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Maybe I had the promise of a soul then. I was a
little Eurasian, with the happy blood of both races charging gayly
through my veins. And I <i>believed</i> tremendously, Atlas, just like
you. Ah&mdash;!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was born in this house of my ancestors. My
father was a Scotchman, of their best clan; my mother was of the East.
All its bloods flowed in her veins. I was taken young to
England&mdash;and there,&rdquo; Isabel said slowly, &ldquo;my mother
disappeared. I came to love my father&rsquo;s land. I went to the
schools there, and dreamed great things. Sometime I too should play a
fine part in the world. Every man, I thought, had his destiny in his
own hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was all a long time ago. Of the seasons I
remember vividly only the time when the primroses open and the English
hedge-lark is aboard.&rdquo; A fierce blue mist veiled the flashing
eyes. &ldquo;Life dies and resurrects itself in England. Every year one
is born anew.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The man was an officer in an English
regiment&mdash;fair as the daylight. On my knees I used to worship him
as a god. Nobody suspected what I was, and I did not myself understand.
He loved me, too&mdash;with the kind of love the English understand. No
fire, no poetry in it&mdash;the love that is just strong <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>enough to manufacture a few pink-cheeked
children for their tidy British homes. I loved him as we of the East
know how to love.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In Europe one marries not merely a man, but a
family. How different from my mother&rsquo;s land, where mates find
each other under the sun! Yet they call it civilization over there.
Well, his family grew suspicious. They had heard tales of my
father&rsquo;s wild youth in strange parts of the world. It sometimes
happens that one must pay a very heavy price for one&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The only retort my father could make was a bigger
dowry. But I was different. I had then sublime ideas of honesty of
soul. My lover, I believed, would love me the more exaltedly for them.
I acknowledged my Malay blood&mdash;all the bloods of the East that ran
through me. I stood up against the wall and did it in a great splendor
of mood.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! You know the rest. When they, when
he&mdash;that European matrimonial compound threw me off, I did
everything that a woman of your race would not have done. I threw
myself in his path at every turn&mdash;offered myself to him on any
terms; for I knew now that never could I exact terms at all.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And he took me on the lowest. West&mdash;East; it
is always the same. He got himself ordered to India. That last
night!&rdquo; Isabel sat up straight. &ldquo;I crept along the brush of
the lane into which he was to turn. An Igorotte from the Mountains had
taught me how to catch my foe. I slid out when he came! I would have
killed him, but the knife was poor. I only wounded him. I had meant to
kill us both, but&mdash;&rdquo; Isabel nonchalantly threw open the
n&eacute;glig&eacute;, and exposed a large scar&mdash;&ldquo;we go on,
do we not, Green <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175"
name="pb175">175</a>]</span>God of the Universe?&rdquo; She turned her
head toward the room where the preposterous idol lived.</p>
<p class="par">To this narrative, told with oriental fervor, of things
quite as beyond her experience of existence as the pits of Erebus,
Julie had listened in a conflict of emotions.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The priest will tell you many things about
me&mdash;among them that a young man killed himself here for me not
long ago. Men may have killed themselves because of me, but not
Grahaeme. He killed himself, not because he was in love with me, but
because he couldn&rsquo;t alter the universe to an Englishman&rsquo;s
idea&mdash;because I was what I shall eternally remain&mdash;an
Eurasian, a mongrel! You see, your Englishman can gloriously destroy
himself, but he can&rsquo;t sacrifice his caste. Grahaeme was jaded by
the East, and he took me to die for. I would never again accept low
terms. A Ghengis Khan, perhaps&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped
short. &ldquo;Yes, I will be unchangeably <i>I</i>, till the end. It is
so decreed. There is something about you, though, that stirs me, and
makes me wish that one died like the English summer and came up anew
with the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie rose, and in a surge of feeling looked down upon
the recumbent figure. For a bare moment Isabel had opened the very
secret gate and let her glimpse in. The girl laid her hand on the olive
shoulder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Those things&mdash;make no difference to
me,&rdquo; she said diffidently. &ldquo;We will always be
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel glanced up at her ironically. &ldquo;Is that a
covenant? Go away, little friend, with your spring insistence! There is
no resurrection here. And Europe shall never see me again! Once I wrote
quaint lyrics, full, they said, of the magic and mystery of the East;
now I am preparing a volume that is not written <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>on
pages&mdash;of things that must shortly stir the race of men.
&lsquo;Waters dried up that the way of the Kings of the East shall be
prepared!&rsquo; Alpha and Omega. Here the struggle of man began, and
here it will end! And &lsquo;he who shall come, taking the peace from
the earth, and making kings&rsquo;! Great resurrected Ghengis Khan!
Where is he? In what recess of Asia is he making ready to sweep the
East to victory? Him my soul awaits. He will put the sun and moon under
my feet!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Half of this world will not sleep forever. The
sleepers of the East will touch their bonds and find them
rotten&mdash;the senile hold of their foreign masters! Then there shall
be such a conflagration as will scatter the very stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel coming suddenly back from her feverish flight,
looked up at Julie. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p class="par">Julie put her hands to her head and pressed it hard, her
lids drawing together with pain. &ldquo;I had a sunstroke in Nahal, and
ever since I&rsquo;ve had a headache. Sometimes it aches as if it would
split my brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel pointed to the adjoining room. &ldquo;Go and lie
down! When you get up the sunlight will be dimmed, and you will be
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie dropped down on a bed that was a mass of crawling
teakwood dragons. All over the walls, from queer prints etched as with
a single hair, gazed fantastic human apparitions wearing their limbs
and features in most extraordinary ways, all supremely triumphant over
space and perspective. Draperies of embroidered landscapes, fine as old
etchings, disclosed temples of woven gold, rivers as fantastic as
dreams, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>and blue mountains over which the mysticism of
the East hung like dew.</p>
<p class="par">She drowsed, and presently the temples of gold threads
expanded into pavilions like the markets she had seen in the city, and
millions of people, thick as flies, passed in and out.</p>
<p class="par">She awoke, and her eyes rested on Isabel, who had so
agitated her brain with strange prophecies and visions. The long hair,
black as the jungle at night, lay curved over her beautiful body; the
blue eyes that judged etchings and old prints were closed, curtained by
heavy lids. The soul seemed to be withdrawn to inaccessible retreats,
afar off perhaps beating its wings against inexorable walls. Only the
mask of the East looked out from the inert form. The Malay woman lay
there asleep&mdash;the woman that could track her enemy, and kill.

<h2 class="main">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Early the next morning, Julie received a note from
Father Hull, in which he informed her that her appointment to the
Manila Department had been arranged. Only one vacancy had
existed&mdash;in the Tondo district, a native section of the city. The
Reredos, the prosperous mestizos who were to accommodate her, had a
large house within easy distance of the school.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel made a wry face over this prospect, and advised
Julie to remain with her as long as possible. Julie had agreed to
remain for the Carnival, but decided that she must go at once to
investigate her new surroundings, and that she must establish herself
there the following day.</p>
<p class="par">Her salary, she learned, had not been increased,
although this prospect had been held out to the teachers for the
beginning of their second year of service. For a city like this, where
high salaried officials set the standard of Americanism, her stipend
was stupendously inadequate. Her financial affairs were in about the
same unsatisfactory state as when they had caused the d&eacute;nouement
in Nahal. She had always to cripple herself by payments to Mrs. Morris,
and there was now Delphine.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel, however, entered into her perplexities to some
purpose. She knew, she said, of a Spanish lawyer who wished to come
abreast of the times by learning English. As Julie&rsquo;s school hours
were from eight in the morning to one o&rsquo;clock, she would have her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>afternoon free to instruct Se&ntilde;or
Sansillo, who was sure to pay well. He was, Isabel said, a pure-blooded
Spaniard of culture, married to an enormously rich mestiza.</p>
<p class="par">Julie set out after breakfast to examine the niche that
had been made for her in the city.</p>
<p class="par">Tondo, at the other side of Manila, was very ancient and
wholly native. It was as flat and sun-bleached as a desert, and had for
its horizon on one side the sea, prognosticative of typhoons; on the
other a wall of high hills where the winds blew against heaven. On
beyond was holy Arayat, lifting its solitary head into space, and
holding, it was said, the Ark buried in its crypt forever beyond the
reach of man. The people of Tondo lived in the very frankness, of
being. Up beyond the ridges were savages who had once been a serious
menace to this part of the city, which lay outside the Christian walls.
Julie came to believe that the soul of this section lay likewise beyond
those Christian borders.</p>
<p class="par">There was a green somnolent river crawling like a senile
old serpent through the District. People swarmed its muddy banks,
fishing in it, washing their bodies and their raiment in it, and
scooping its awful water into drinking jars. So universal was its
utility, it might have been the River of Life itself. Old stone bridges
lent an undeserved dignity to the vile, green thing, which, set as it
was into the core of the people&rsquo;s life, was bound to have its
grain of the picturesque.</p>
<p class="par">A few of the streets were broad and long, but packed
with shops of tarnished brilliancy of color that looked like pigeon
holes and illustrated all vocations from Abraham&rsquo;s time down to
the present. These booths made the streets look like dingy fragments of
some old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>rainbow discarded out of the skies. From the
robin&rsquo;s egg blue regions of an &ldquo;Esquela de Baile,&rdquo;
the abandoned notes of a Zingarella tinkled forth in defiance of the
feverish heat of the day, as if its incantation would set the whole
street to dancing like tarantulas.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Booth of Miraculous Refreshment&rdquo; was
yellow and blue, with orange colored festoons, and before its
dilapidated wooden tables its patrons imbibed its elixir without any
special demonstration of exhilarance. In the &ldquo;Peaceful
Barberia&rdquo; two natives were matching a pair of ferocious cocks.
The &ldquo;Patriotic Clam&rdquo; offered ice-cream as the medium of its
contact with the public. Next to the &ldquo;Bar of the Orient,&rdquo;
in suggestive proximity, was the &ldquo;Resigned Funeria,&rdquo; done
in apple-green and having on exhibition hosts of pink satin coffins
drowned in lace.</p>
<p class="par">However ignominiously born, the native gets even with
the universe by going splendidly to his grave.</p>
<p class="par">Beyond the row of Chinese rice shops, infants&rsquo;
baptismal robes in waves of purple and cerise ruffles smote the eye.
The tiny, vivid gala company of elfin shells suggested the shapes of an
unborn race about to enter the colorful, enigmatic destiny of the
East.</p>
<p class="par">One street was marvelous in the energy and variety of
its human service. In a single square one could have one&rsquo;s teeth
pulled by an experienced Japanese, one&rsquo;s voice trained, through
heaven knows what agency of the East; one&rsquo;s toe nails pared, or
one&rsquo;s self completely mesmerized by a thrillingly bearded Hindoo,
whose placarded likeness gave forth sparks in every direction and
guaranteed, in large print to all patrons absolute irresistibility in
love.</p>
<p class="par">Agipito, from environs of violently stained glass,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>announced a &ldquo;brokerage,&rdquo; and
advertised pearls from the Sulu. The riches of the East passed across
this pawn broker&rsquo;s palms. Perfecto Abbas was a lawyer. Access to
his conference room was gained through a small swinging door, such as
is characteristic of places of alcoholic refreshment, and which
possibly was here employed to stimulate trade. Zee Woo, a <i lang=
"es">lavendero</i> of the first class with his mouth as a sprinkler,
was to be seen blowing water over the clothes he was ironing. There
were Chinamen everywhere, like djinn in goblin depths, fingering
abacuses, as if searching for the mystic equation of wealth.</p>
<p class="par">The Street! The Street! Bartering and bargaining,
following its oriental, alien and inconjecturable way. Birth is
accidental, death inevitable, but the exchange of things that are mine
and the things that are thine will go on to eternity.</p>
<p class="par">The native of the East takes his entrance into the
universe philosophically. He attaches to himself no importance and
definitely expects little, except death. He has even a graceful way of
meeting that. The native of the West refuses to allude to this common
human casualty, of which he has a horror. The Filipino, on the other
hand, nonchalantly displays and even takes pleasure in his colorful
coffins, and when the time comes acquiescently sinks into them; for he
knows that he is a poor creature with little to cling to, and he is
humbly grateful for his day in the sun.</p>
<p class="par">His intransitoriness of soul extends throughout his
whole existence. He erects houses that the winds of the sea sweep away;
he stores no treasure on earth; he lives from day to day. To-morrow is
so inconceivable a mystery that he relegates to it everything that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>he cannot comfortably compass to-day. By
to-morrow he may have dropped gracefully, unresistingly out of the
problems of the world. As a race he appears to cherish no ambition of
permanency on the globe. Idling in his shops, he wonderingly watches
the gnarled Chinese water-carrier go by, bowed under his load. It does
not occur to him that the Chinaman bites the dust, that his sons and
his sons&rsquo; sons may survive.</p>
<p class="par">It was into this existence that Julie was coming to
dwell.</p>
<p class="par">The long street thinned out, fields intervened. Finally
Julie saw a house sitting back isolated among a great deal of foliage
near a bridge. It was of the old Spanish type and had once, probably,
harbored fine foreigners. All but buried under the great palms, it
looked remote, shaded, and cool after the dust of the sun-swept street.
She got out of her carromata, and finding the iron gate in the stone
wall that surrounded the estate open, walked in. The rhythmic click of
wooden slippers across a stone floor and the soft drip of water caught
Julie&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="par">A muchacho appeared in response to her knocks and led
her upstairs to a sala furnished with a piano, a marble-topped table, a
heterogeneous array of conch shells, and some startling looking
portraits of persons of extraordinarily blended race. Se&ntilde;ora
Reredo entered the room, a tall woman with a slight stoop and a passive
gentleness of face. She was in native costume, all black. Genteel
native women are almost always dressed in mourning. She led Julie to a
large airy room, well furnished and over-looking the garden. She
mentioned a sum which, while not extravagant, was not completely
gratifying. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When they returned to the sala the children came
trooping in, quietly sparkling little folk in European clothes. The
Se&ntilde;ora said that next year they would sell the old house which
she had inherited and go back to Spain where the children could be
educated. Her husband had an apothecary business, which he would sell
out.</p>
<p class="par">The Se&ntilde;ora said that she was going back to the
land of her father&rsquo;s people. His blood had sojourned afar long
enough. Julie glanced up at the human array on the wall, and
wondered.</p>
<p class="par">A shriek burst from the children, and simultaneously an
energetic, purposeful, round pink pig with an uplifted curl of a tail
burst into the room. He was looking for the children who had deserted
him. He clearly knew his way about, for he at once dashed behind the
piano where the youngest had hidden away from him, and gave forth
squeals of joyful discovery. The Se&ntilde;ora ordered the children to
take the beast out. He went in the utmost rebellion.</p>
<p class="par">Julie did not say anything about Delphine. She was
distressfully at sea concerning him. Isabel had offered to keep him,
but for some not clearly defined reason, Julie did not wish to leave
him with her. She left the Se&ntilde;ora with his problem still
unsolved.</p>
<p class="par">Returning, she found Isabel in a disguise of costume so
splendid it thrilled one like a poem. She had a tower of jewels on her
head. Her body was incased in a kind of closely clinging filagree of
shining armor studded with great gems&mdash;which, however, left
considerable of the concrete, natural Isabel exposed. Her blue eyes
sparkled like the great head jewels of a goddess. She looked as if she
had been looted from some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>temple. Nobody, Julie decided,
would be able to entertain a pretension alongside her. Her own Pleiad
mistiness seemed to dissolve before this glory.</p>
<p class="par">Yet Isabel came over to her and, flicking Julie&rsquo;s
neck with the end of her nail, exclaimed: &ldquo;That white, white
skin&mdash;fit for the mantle of an archangel to come down to earth in!
And that white fire back of you! Have you an appointment with the
millennium of the soul of man that you can contrive to look like that?
Take me along, Julie&mdash;take me along!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel was obliged to leave early, but she had provided
an escort for Julie; no less a person than Governor Shell of the
Mohammedan Group. Julie had heard a lot about this strange, dark hermit
of a man, and wondered how he came to be attending such a function; but
Isabel explained that he was visiting the Governor-General, and
couldn&rsquo;t very well help himself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he wanted to take
me,&rdquo; Julie demurred. &ldquo;He is said to dislike
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Isabel declared,
unabashed; &ldquo;but when I told him about your exile on an island not
far from his own, his missionary instinct was touched. You
couldn&rsquo;t go with any one more distinguished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Governor Shell entered the room, Julie felt at once
the force of his somber, reticent personality. She observed that he did
not look very young, and that he had a strained sweated look as if he
were pushing himself always just beyond the margin of what a man might
reasonably do. It was a dark world in which he worked, in the hope of
stumbling on the formula that would transform the preternaturally
vicious psychologies of the Moros. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In their common experience of the far Southern Islands
they found a great deal to talk about. When they reached the Governor
General&rsquo;s mansion, the balconies were glittering with lights
festooned like fireflies against the darkness. The Palace sat in huge
grounds, one side of which touched the street Malaca&ntilde;ang, while
the other dropped down to the Pasig, along which the gala boats were to
appear.</p>
<p class="par">Everybody was crowded onto the galleries in whimsies of
costumes. Seats had been reserved for Governor Shell, and he and Julie
sat down near the judges of the carnival. Almost all of these people
were prominent personages, unknown to Julie; so the Governor explained
them to her.</p>
<p class="par">The tall lady in the handsome native costume and the
rope of pearls was the wife of the Governor-General. Julie admired her
graceful dignity. Colonel Messenger, the man next to her, was one of
the biggest Americans in Manila; he had straightened out the land
problem, which the religious orders had engendered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He and his family are what you might call typical
colonists,&rdquo; the Governor said. &ldquo;They have settled down on
the soil. That young man at his side is his eldest
son&mdash;Chad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He scarcely seems as large a structure as his
father,&rdquo; Julie commented, &ldquo;&mdash;but what a fury of
dreaming he has in his face! Isn&rsquo;t he the one Isabel told me
of&mdash;who married a mestiza in order to serve the East, and who
believes we are in the process of remaking it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Governor nodded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great friend of
Barry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie seized the opportunity to ask the question that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>had been for days on her lips, but which she had
somehow refrained from putting to Isabel.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is he back?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. He got in on the <i>Rohilla Maru</i>
yesterday. Brought a Chinaman with him&mdash;a Sun Yat Sen Something, I
think the name was. He likes to show them what&rsquo;s going on
here&mdash;and he&rsquo;s the one to do it. He has not only had the
experience, but he has the intuition which makes him understand the
life of the East. He has had a great deal more than most people
imagine, to do with the formation of the first representative
government over here. He and Caples make a strong team.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Governor Shell pointed out a tubby, deeply tanned, and
patriarchally bearded little man; and Julie remembered his name as that
of the head of the Commission and a well known scientist.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry hasn&rsquo;t the training of Caples, and
Caples hasn&rsquo;t Barry&rsquo;s faith. Caples is ironic, and believes
the Americans are going to get tired, as they usually do, and quit,
leaving the worst tangle the East ever saw. Science and acute
deductions take the faith out of a man, and faith, I believe,&rdquo;
the Governor said hesitatingly, &ldquo;is one of the great natural
forces. It enables Barry to convince a native quicker than any other
white man in the East can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Governor took out his watch, as if he were in the
habit of living by it. &ldquo;Not a float so far!&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the way&mdash;you wait and wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the Moros never keep you waiting a
minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He smiled. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not
enjoying myself! Nobody ever heard me talk so much in my life.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie who had been studying the face of the man who had
married the Eurasian&mdash;to save the East, demanded:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does Chad Messenger believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That things are very bad on the earth and need
what he calls a Great Change. He talks a lot about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He looks,&rdquo; Julie reflected, &ldquo;as if he
had great expectations. What do you think he expects?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, some sort of metamorphosis in which the earth
will break out of its grub&rsquo;s existence into a winged thing.
Wars&mdash;perhaps a lot of them, plagues or earthquakes or even a big
war which, like Noah&rsquo;s flood, would wipe out part of the world
and start the rest all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It sounds apocalyptical.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He and Barry have a lot of these East Indian
mystics for friends, and they have a grand prophetical time together. I
say the future is a disease with them,&rdquo; the Governor
grumbled.</p>
<p class="par">Two men were entering the select group of judges. The
more noticeable of the two was tall and of that consumptive leanness
frequent among the scholarly type of Oriental. His pale yellow face was
indicative of a Mongolian infusion of blood&mdash;a face full of
arresting attributes which were yet unaccountably screened to the
Occidental eye.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pablo Orcullu!&rdquo; Shell remarked.
&ldquo;Recognized leader of the Filipino people. Some think him very
strong&mdash;but notice that stoop in the shoulders, the
scholars&rsquo; stoop! That&rsquo;s Pablo&rsquo;s kismet. He may scheme
ever so splendidly, but when his moment comes that will hold him back.
His kind haven&rsquo;t learned to think largely and act largely
simultaneously. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Orcullu,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;admires Barry.
He owned a big dead old city down South, and he sent for Barry to come
down and help him build it over in fine new cement. He says Barry is
the biggest white man in the East.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The sad little fat fellow? De Cadegas. They said
in Europe, where he studied, that he had one of the finest voices in
the world. But there was the Tobacco Factory which spelled the universe
in dollars to his parents; so the nightingale of the East counts
tobacco leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The first float now emerged into view upon the river,
through fantastically light foliage. It brought the Governor to his
feet with an exclamation. Crimson silken sails, like the enormous
petals of a flower outspread to the night, glided beneath them. In the
boat stood a conclave of Moro chieftains in their vivid costumes of
coral red, tight velvet trousers and jackets buttoned with gold coins,
with turbans and gorgeous serongs, and brightly cruel spears and curved
swords.</p>
<p class="par">Julie gave a little cry as she recognized one of the
figures&mdash;Dicky-Dicky, the dwarf of Isabel&rsquo;s household, in
the glittering regalia of a rajah, his small person redolent with
princely dignity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That scrap of a man was actually a Rajah
once!&rdquo; Governor Shell leaned down to inform her. &ldquo;It lasted
only a few months, unfortunately for history, for I hear he made a wise
and progressive ruler. The real Rajah, Bulai, was, by a queer chance,
also a dwarf, and in appearance very nearly the twin of the captured
Visayan slave. Bulai was a timid prince, afraid of his
responsibilities; so between the two mannikins it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>was
cooked up that Dicky-Dicky should impersonate the Rajah.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The tribe, however, found it out, and it was from
a particularly undesirable end that Dicky-Dicky was saved, through the
medium of a vast amount of gold, by our friend Isabel, who happened to
be visiting somewhere thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And so poor Dicky-Dicky will never reign
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. He may break out again.
He may have his kingdom re&euml;stablished by the government that
Isabel plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Up the river now was coming a caricature of the
Archipelago. Queen Philippinitis in crown and robe with unstockinged
feet and flapping slippers cocked shockingly up before her, and smoking
a dreadful cigar a yard long. Under her arm she hugged a huge bespurred
cock. She was politely ignored by the official party, but was
everywhere else hailed with vociferous appreciation.</p>
<p class="par">Then came the float that Julie had been waiting
for&mdash;Isabel&rsquo;s marble barge, carved and tinted with indigo,
lit from stem to stern, and crowded with Asiatic figures, from the
steppes of the Tartar to the borders of the Kurd. In the center of
these human arabesques sat Isabel enshrined. She had wonderfully
contrived it all, and there could be no doubt about the
pre&euml;minence of the float.</p>
<p class="par">Then quite suddenly the attention of the beholders was
drawn to a tall brown man who stood on top of the barge with a long
propelling pole in his hand. In the striking suggestion of his posture
and the occasional glimpses of his brown uplifted features, he managed
to <span class="corr" id="xd21e2947" title=
"Source: convery">convey</span> a significance that transcended the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>glory below. There below reposed the ancient,
static, and unstable magnificence of the East; but above&mdash;alert,
upright, asking its question of the future and the judgment of white
men&mdash;was the Man-Soul of Asia. The boat drifted off into the
shadows, but that brown image remained, graven on the brains of those
who saw it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That was Barry!&rdquo; Julie said half under her
breath. She stared around at this strange galaxy of people, whose
background of the East gave them a touch of fantasy. These days of the
Empire, or creation&mdash;when a fragment of the East was shaking under
a stupendous renovation! And back of it, these dauntless men and women
who were stirringly pledged to the resurrection! A new world must take
shape under their will, a world of the best ideals.</p>
<p class="par">There was an exhilaration in the air, an elixir working
upon an ancient life. An intoxication came over Julie as she watched
and listened to the music. The faces melted into a phantasmagoria, a
marching host dedicated to the East and sweeping on to shape its mighty
fate. Visions and dreams pulsated to the music&mdash;strains of India,
Malaysia, of far Mongolia woven into its throbbing war-like tones.
There must be some place in the march for her! Some time in the
Experiment that place would unfold and give her a part in the big
things these men&rsquo;s brows portended. Hope quivered through her
like the life-giving warmth of the sun.</p>
<p class="par">They arose from their seats, and started to mingle in
the throng. Julie felt some one seize her arm. It was Ellis Wilbur, the
girl who had pointed people out to her that first memorable night in
Manila.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How is the girl-hermit? I am so glad to see her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>back&mdash;though I wager that Providence has
taken no note of the things she has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie returned the greeting warmly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you see Barry McChord?&rdquo; Ellis asked.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just like him to drive the things home with
hammer and tongs?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you feel at home in this Cataclysm
here?&rdquo; she demanded abruptly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t! Yet it makes
my mind spring as if I had found another dimension for it. A long time
hence, no doubt, I shall look back upon it with the thrill of some
splendid adventure in which I ever so little engaged. I&rsquo;m not a
participant. I don&rsquo;t care about the East, but I do care very much
about the courage of this attempt to disperse the dust of ages; of
which the smell is all over the East, in the hovels of the poor and the
decayed dwellings of kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As she started away, she remarked: &ldquo;Isabel, I
hear, has lost the best one of her stupendous bracelets in the water,
and is frightfully cross. Don&rsquo;t let her quarrel with
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A wild throb shot through Julie&rsquo;s pulses. There
above the crowd was again the Excelsior face&mdash;that fantastic name
she had given it, oh, so long ago! The tawny head was watchfully alert,
as if it were used to scanning great distances. The face, glowing and
vital, had a desert tan, and in it was a hint of the desert&rsquo;s
awesome solitudes. His light, vigorous frame seemed to have been built
for heroic purposes. It struck Julie that here was the real Atlas to
hold the New World on his unbending shoulders.</p>
<p class="par">Julie watched him breathlessly. People stopped him
everywhere to talk. Still he was advancing in her direction. Her heart
pumped so that the blood seemed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192"
href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>to be escaping all over her
body. When he was quite near, his eyes turned in her direction. He
stared hard, and an abrupt change came over his face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be you!&rdquo; he said before her,
as if he expected her to contradict him. Then he added: &ldquo;Some
time, of course, I knew you would come back! But it&rsquo;s been such a
long time. Something seemed to swallow you up after that night&mdash;on
the roof, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She did remember, and it was plain that he remembered
too, just as if many sorry months had not intervened. Very few people
were like that&mdash;capable of taking up, as if it had just been
dropped, the mood of the past. And they were back in it easily at once.
It was only by an extreme chance that she was here at all. In these
improbable times, where life shifted as upon a screen from day to day,
any expectations were preposterous. Yet he accepted her reappearance as
something that was bound to come about in chance. His certainty that
they would meet again seemed strange at first, and then the strangeness
vanished.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was called out of the room&mdash;to the cholera
situation in Leyte, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he went on, looking
intently at her. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d be back at
once&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way over here. But when I did return, you
had disappeared completely&mdash;not a clew to you left.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie smiled grimly. &ldquo;The East misled me for a
while. Now that it has found me again, I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was thought that you had gone back to the
States&mdash;but I knew somehow that you had not. How did you happen to
go so far away?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was you who sent me, that night. You breathed
the fire into me that started me going. But I couldn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>show you, or God, or anybody a thing that I have
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His far-seeking, gold-colored eyes flamed through her.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea that stalks us all. And we can&rsquo;t
live an age or two to find out what all this fine fever of our actions
will boil down to. We can only go on believing that our particular fire
is unquenchable. I have my misgivings, too. There are shadows lifting
on the horizon at this moment that may portend untold calamity. But I
am perfectly positive that victory&mdash;far along the road,
perhaps&mdash;is ahead.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As for my sending you away,&rdquo; he exclaimed
swiftly, &ldquo;one does not, for all the causes that animate the
earth, send persons like you away. How could I&mdash;a being all
star-dust and light?&rdquo; He looked in admiration upon her shining
youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am a Pleiad!&rdquo; Julie explained.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me where the other six are. There was no time
for the human things&mdash;and a Pleiad was easy, just a puff of
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how glad I was
to have found you&mdash;only to have you slip out, like a ship in a
dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was regarding her deeply, as if he would search out
the things that were printed most indelibly on the plate of her
mind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have changed!&rdquo; he decided abruptly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not quite so young?&rdquo; She laughed wryly.
&ldquo;Nahal helped to cure that raw curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come out on the gallery, and let&rsquo;s
talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They walked to the end of the gallery overlooking the
river, which, like a current of silver, stretched down through the
city. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;when you
were the means of sending me forth, I went believing that I was going
to work miracles. I lived terribly stirred by that idea all the
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And inevitably you must have performed them.
It&rsquo;s the time for miracles!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For you, yes.&rdquo; She looked up admiringly to
his heroic height. &ldquo;But you see, I am only a village
school-teacher and not a prince of the East. It was my beloved island,
though, down there, my own domain I thought. I was to have done so
much, but I really did nothing at all. All my grand purposes came to
nothing. I tried to bring peace, and lift up a generation of
light&mdash;that is, it always seems to me I tried to do that&mdash;and
they took the children all away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The tears sprang to her eyes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get
over it&mdash;or forget it. Right there a fine sheath that enveloped me
dropped to pieces. I was wholly unhappy and unsuccessful. My friends
died or ceased to believe in me; my people that I was to have led to
the Promised Land&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried, turning to
him, &ldquo;break your heart with a dream like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His eyes, full of commiseration, flamed at her last
words into visionary light. &ldquo;I dream,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;of the whole darkened lengths of the East! The better state is
coming,&rdquo; he continued more gently, &ldquo;not to one land or one
race but to the whole Humanity&mdash;and the East must be in the
Change, too. Up from the muddy Caliban that it is there will rise a
soul to fashion a new Asia after the ideals which we brought across the
sea from the greatest Republic of the world. Some time not so far off,
mark my words, common coolies,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;shall stand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>in the Holy courts of the Forbidden City and in
the Temple of the Great Lama at Lhassa, the two most inviolate spots on
earth, and proclaim the equality of men!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His face was afire. He thrust his strong nervous hands
through his rumpled hair.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Some of us are daring to play a bigger game than
that of this archipelago. We are bidding for stakes that are far in the
future. I was in China for years before I came here&mdash;I am steeped
in it, I&rsquo;ll confess that, I have more than one iron in the fire.
The times are beginning to take point. As an old Brahmin priest I know
says; the souls of men are making ready all over the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He tingled all over with a power that seemed to
communicate itself electrically to her. It was fine to be near him, to
be in his atmosphere. He made her transcend her human self for a while,
bore her forth on the crest of universal things.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want you to see the sort of things that
I&rsquo;m bound up in!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want you to enter a
little into my beliefs. Though, after all, we are floating on the
waters of mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A big black enigma, it all seems to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You speak as if you do not expect a
solution!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Things will have to clear awfully for
that&mdash;for me at least. I have no expectations any more. Women are
not heroic over here. The men do the big things. I thought I was an
apostle. I find I am only a woman tramp through the East&mdash;who has
lost her quest. I have made a mistake. Perhaps I should turn
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! Don&rsquo;t talk that way. Be as wild as you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>please in your dreams, this is the background
for them. If you could see the extent of the domain over which my
aspirations dare to play! You&rsquo;d think I was truly an Arabian
Nights&rsquo; romancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell me about this domain of dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His gaze traveled far, very far off, it seemed.
&ldquo;My territory of the soul goes over Asia. I have stood on a tower
of the Wall and have looked over the stretches of the desert, towards
the heights of the Himalayas, beyond the reach of eyes. Below me lay
the great uncomprehending land across which men were moving in their
bitter inadequate fates. I wanted to march with them, soul to soul. I
wanted to stir them to struggle and revolt. I wanted them to find a new
vision. Those,&rdquo; he said, turning back to her, &ldquo;are still my
hopes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen China,&rdquo; Julie said,
after a pause. &ldquo;I have always wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It will be the most staggering fact of the
future. One scarcely dares speculate upon it, it is so incalculably
vast and undecipherable. Think of the potentialities of three times our
soul muster. Conceive of the disaster to the world if by any accident
in a generation or two this human force arrayed itself on the wrong
side! In the Boxer Rebellion, the people were hitting blindly at the
world, when in reality they meant to strike at their own rotten
government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His voice dropped. &ldquo;What some of us who love China
want to do is to put her on the right side of the bars&mdash;change the
habit of mind of centuries; wipe out those old ivory chess-men in
Pekin, and set the young China on her winged way. And for that we are
willing to go to almost any lengths.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you trusting a stranger with secret
affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You were never a stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Under this bestowal of faith, Julie recalled the night
on the roof.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to thank you,&rdquo; she said with
feeling, &ldquo;for helping me in Nahal. I was in sore
straits.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I had known&mdash;&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">Finding no words with which to push away the obstacle of
Nahal, she swept on quickly: &ldquo;Do you know what I might do with my
Filipino ward? He&rsquo;s a small brown creature for whom there
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a place in the world. I&rsquo;m not a capable
Providence, I fear. He wouldn&rsquo;t be left behind, so I just had to
bring him along with me&mdash;though what I was to do with an
eleven-year-old Filipino boy, I couldn&rsquo;t think. But you should
have seen his little face that day looking across the water toward the
magic lands. I seldom know what to do with myself, to say nothing of
anybody else. What do you think I could do with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Give him to me. The boys in my house have their
duties so confounded that domestic activity has very nearly come to a
halt. Delphine who is just from the Provinces, and honest, can act as
an official tattle-tale and break the gang. Why should you be
discouraged over the nonconformity of the island of Nahal,&rdquo; he
demanded, &ldquo;when I cannot evoke industry from a single native in
my home?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie pondered. &ldquo;He ought to go to school,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;You see, he&rsquo;s a very special person. He&rsquo;s
caught the fire, too, and wants to forge ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is a school within a few squares of my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>house. We&rsquo;ll let him go right on to school
till he makes a destiny for himself, and some day when he&rsquo;s
president of the Philippine republic, he&rsquo;ll raise a statue to you
on the Luneta, as the Light of Ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think I must have stumbled on a fairy
god-father!&rdquo; Julie smiled. &ldquo;But they say you&rsquo;re that
to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. I&rsquo;ve never been as
nice to anybody as I&rsquo;ve been to you. Don&rsquo;t dream for a
minute that I go round adopting stray children that everybody has
picked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better go and
move about a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They came near a group of people who seemed to have
congregated in a corner of a room. Julie heard the word &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Independencia!</i>&rdquo; burst with a little shock into the midst
of them.</p>
<p class="par">A man spoke up as if in answer to its challenge:
&ldquo;We are within the walls of the East&mdash;where we were called
by Fate&mdash;for issues greater than we can to-day foresee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie remembered the speaker, Matfield Barron, whom
Ellis Wilbur had described to her. She saw that he was addressing
Isabel, who stood smiling with quiet irony.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Woman of the Cross-roads!&rdquo; he went on
whimsically, &ldquo;who have the East and the West in your
veins&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Warring impulses rippled for a moment across
Isabel&rsquo;s face. As she stood there, torn by contentions of her
race, her remarkable emotions in play, Julie perceived how different
she was from every other woman in the room. Here was a woman who
thought as deeply as any of them, who certainly transcended
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>all of them in beauty and gifts, and yet who,
nevertheless, belonged beyond the margin.</p>
<p class="par">Some resentful flame burned through her discretion.
&ldquo;Under a master, can personality be preserved?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But yet a little while we must tarry, to lay down
the foundation stones,&rdquo; Matfield explained.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Seven times seven civilizations are buried under
the soil of Asia. Wait till you get as crowded as we are over here,
till the very oceans are disputed&mdash;then behold the earth running
with blood, and the seas on fire. You of the West struggle to expurgate
from the East its human passions. You strive to teach it to inhabit
your high altruistic plateau. But, you, yourselves, shall yet at some
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3103" title=
"Source: surpreme">supreme</span> urge revert to the most stupendous of
those human passions. In one concentrated hour all your elevated
mankind shall be at one another&rsquo;s throats like wolves. You will
do well to keep the East quiet then while you tear out one
another&rsquo;s hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry alone after this explosion regarded Isabel with
impartial interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible, of course!&rdquo; he
told Julie in an undertone, &ldquo;but you know every time she talks
like that, I almost believe her. She sounds like St. John, and
I&rsquo;ve always had an inkling that he was dead right. The
Armageddon! Toppling thrones! But it won&rsquo;t happen in my
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You seem sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I want to take part in the
renewing of the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It exhilarates you and depresses me. This is
struggle enough for me. You see, I have ten million timid grandmothers
back of me and it is some task to give them all a jolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel stepped nearer them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was that the Yellow Peril you were talking about,
Isabel?&rdquo; Holborne smiled into his mustache.</p>
<p class="par">Her olive face flushed proudly. &ldquo;The peril of a
United East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And Ghengis Khan and his hordes will again
overrun us?&rdquo; he asked ironically.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! If only he would arise! If only somebody
strong, strong would come!&rdquo; Her gaze wandered desperately to the
spot where Julie and Barry stood.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you have another land!&rdquo; Matfield Barren
expostulated. &ldquo;When you lift those violet eyes of yours, I have
visions of long rolling uplands, with gray mist upon them, and of the
sun, and thyme, and quiet sheep.&rdquo; He came nearer, and spoke in a
low, persuasive tone. &ldquo;We belong now to the East&mdash;the East
that rejects no man; nevertheless, let us drink to that other
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He led her off to the punch bowl, but Julie saw that she
refused the cup he offered her. Some of these people seemed to have a
great deal shut up in their hearts. Julie remembered Ellis&rsquo;s
warning, and made a move toward Isabel; but just then somebody began to
sing.</p>
<p class="par">Julie thrilled with delight. The Arabian Nights&rsquo;
Tales to music! One saw them all, Sindbad, Aladdin, Sheherazade, The
Calenders and the Kings float wondrously by in arabesques of
inconceivable tints of melody. Like magic the colorful splendor of
Asian loves unfurled. The voice had a divine aroma, as if weighted with
the fragrance of the gardens of Paradise.</p>
<p class="par">Then it took on a new tone, and became intolerable in
its play upon the soul. The girl wanted to escape. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>It
struck too deep. It challenged the Judgment Day. Her gaze traveled
around those groups of faces. Barry&rsquo;s desert face looked as if he
saw the veil lifted and the world in full completion of his dreams.
Isabel&rsquo;s twilight face was tense with suppressed exultation. The
enigmatic being, Orcullu, did not appear to stir, but a fire was
growing in his eyes. Shell&rsquo;s somber face stared stonily into the
night; Matfield Barren&rsquo;s sash drooped forlornly at his side;
Holborne looked into his hard hands, as if to read over their story;
Leah Chamberlain was fluttering distressfully, like a bird whose wings
had been caught; Chad Messenger looked suddenly pinched and weary,
while Ellis Wilbur from the edge of the group caught Julie&rsquo;s eye
as if to challenge her to say that all this was not a dream.</p>
<p class="par">The man who counted tobacco leaves left the piano.</p>
<p class="par">The throng of guests gradually dissolved. While Isabel
turned to speak a final word to Orcullu, Barry bent to Julie from his
great height.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to take you for a drive
to-morrow, to show you what&rsquo;s happened while you were
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Their eyes caught in a moment of golden fire. The night
on the roof of his house came back to her with a rush of overpowering
recollections. Not until Isabel thrust herself between them, could she
bring herself back into the self out of which she had been
transported.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel seemed volcanically to drive them apart. She
stood looking from one to the other. Barry made a move toward the
stairs. Isabel stopped him, the blue fire of her eyes ravaging his
face. Julie moved away. As she walked down the steps, she glanced back
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>saw the two figures still standing at the head
of the stairs. Isabel&rsquo;s shadowy face was lifted&mdash;the wide
gold bands glittering on her arms. She looked as she did in her moments
of vision, as if her imagination perceived and was holding up to Barry
the power of which she dreamed.</p>
<p class="par">Julie undressed in her ornate bed-chamber, but she did
not attempt to go to sleep. She leaned pensively against one of the
carved bed posts, and stared out into the night, where the moon&rsquo;s
great searchlight, exploring the cities of the earth, was turned full
on this Eastern one. A shining city, in the realms of darkness! Below
lay the river with the bowed sleeping foliage of its shores. Riding its
smooth current was a sliver of a boat, in it a solitary native caroling
down the stream. How often had she watched other little boats riding
silver waters in artless celebrativeness! Nahal, so far away! It would
never be anything but her unconquerable kingdom&mdash;the dead garden
of her soul.</p>
<p class="par">All around her here were big deeds. What was the
accolade these men possessed, and which she still had not found? Shell
had ceded his life to it. Because of it Barry grappled tirelessly with
races of men. Where among these architects of the future did she
belong? She had enrolled her spirit among them. She had been so sure
that there was a share for her in this splendid achievement. But the
Great Adventure had passed her over. She was not metal for its
forging.</p>
<p class="par">But it was a hard way&mdash;this way of these agents of
the future. Could one go on laboring forever in blind belief? The great
structure these men were rearing might fall to pieces like a house of
cards at the stroke of Isabel and Orcullu. If the Americans gave up the
Islands, as it appeared they might do&mdash;a puff <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>of
smoke in the cosmos, and that would be the end of the whole thing.</p>
<p class="par">She crept into bed, and dreamed of Barry as Atlas
struggling to uphold a world that was falling over her head.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie spent the morning after the carnival
arranging the transfer of her effects to the Tondo. Isabel remained in
bed, and did not emerge till Barry appeared at four o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p class="par">Barry was driving a swift powerful horse hitched to a
light rubber-tired trap&mdash;a rather unusual combination for Manila.
He greeted them both in his radiant manner as he came up the
stairs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am going to take you to Father
Hull&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said to Julie. &ldquo;He asked me to bring you
over.&rdquo; Then, with quick intuition, noticing the bag in
Julie&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s your luggage, we&rsquo;ll
land you at your new home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He swept the bag out of her grasp, and smiled down upon
her. &ldquo;I am going to show you the miracle of Manila!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie, turning to Isabel to bid her good-by, was
startled by the expression she surprised upon her face. Isabel was
agitated about something. Her mood had shot up for an instant like an
angry flame. Julie had a vague idea that she might be displeased with
her for not accepting her invitation to stay on with her. She renewed
her expressions of gratitude to Isabel, and said she would return soon
to see her.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel said they should see each other often&mdash;quite
often. She kissed Julie, and advised her to keep out of the
sun&mdash;&ldquo;because of the headaches,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish there were something to stop them,&rdquo;
said Julie. &ldquo;They rage all through the heat of the day.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Isabel regarded her closely for a moment, then withdrew
her eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Quite unconscious of any disturbance of the ether, Barry
passed his arm through Julie&rsquo;s and together they descended the
stairs. He assisted her into the trap, and picked up the reins with
vast satisfaction. &ldquo;I drive myself,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;because I can&rsquo;t bear to sit idle behind a swift
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The powerful animal sprang through the streets, and
whirred them across towering iron bridges. They passed the skeleton of
a huge new hospital, the frameworks of a new school and other public
buildings. Over one vacant piece of ground, Barry drew up in
fervor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Site of the new university!&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;Rizal&rsquo;s dream. It&rsquo;s only a few lines on paper so
far&mdash;but it&rsquo;s on the way.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These buildings cannot be shaken or blown down
like paper; and something more than a race of columbines must come to
be born in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie peered up into his face. &ldquo;I never saw
anybody so filled with a thing as you are with all this. I don&rsquo;t
believe you have a soul separate from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He smiled. &ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m fearfully busy, and happy as a lark. Oh, but I don&rsquo;t
want them to shut down on all this!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nuisance to be finite,&rdquo; he
declared; &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t be in two or three places at once. I
can&rsquo;t leave here now, yet we&rsquo;ve got to keep the wheels of
the Asiatic car of civilization on the tracks. Now that the Assembly
has cut loose, I&rsquo;m holding my breath. It&rsquo;s a grand time to
be alive!&rdquo; Barry declared, relapsing, as he occasionally did,
into Irish idiom. &ldquo;Now, when the whole world is constructive.
Once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>when I was in Dublin, off my ship, an old woman
looked in my palm and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great destruction
that&rsquo;s coming!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;To me?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;To the whole earth,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t ask for the telling of
the whole world&rsquo;s fortune,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s your fortune, and
everyman&rsquo;s,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;But after it&rsquo;s
blown off the globe, a glorious time will be coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;And what am I to be doing with myself
until then?&rsquo; I demanded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Travel Eastward!&rsquo; she
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie looked at him curiously. In a flash she recalled
the conversation with Chad Messenger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you think is going to happen?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The shaking out of the old countries of the
freedom of man; the bringing down of a few wills, and the placing on
top of the whole will. A change in the destiny of man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, if as much of a change can be realized as
has been already realized here in so short a time, I am ready to
believe in anything! Look hard at your city, and wonder at the magic
that has transformed a dirty, insanitary Malay city to&mdash;well,
almost an oriental City Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;It shall be the
cleanest in the world when we get through, but many a dark enemy lurks
in our path. Look at those stagnant moats, infested with pythons and
myrmidons of death&mdash;and at the drainage system! When will they
attune their oriental ears to the truths of sanitation? And the
cholera-infected food they smuggle in from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>provinces! No, all is not well; and yet, help me
Heaven, they believe back home that we&rsquo;ve finished&mdash;that
these people should now lead themselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you are here to drive the unclean spirits
out.&rdquo; Julie smiled absently to herself. &ldquo;I think so often
of what you told me that first night, about your coming upon this city
which was to inspire your whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true I never saw China really as she
is to be until I saw her in this new light. You see, I wasn&rsquo;t
always an American. I guess that&rsquo;s why all this impressed me so.
You people over there take your heritage too much for granted. I was
born in Ireland&mdash;a racked, wretched country, like those of the
East&mdash;and of very poor people. My father and his father&rsquo;s
father, as far back as you can think, had been at the eternally losing
game of trying to make a living on this earth off another man&rsquo;s
land.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It came over me when I was a
lad&rdquo;&mdash;Barry frowned out at the land-scape&mdash;&ldquo;that
there was no hope whatever for me. My mother&mdash;who was of good
family, and had married beneath her, as they say&mdash;taught me out of
books, and stirred the urge in me. She was a wistful woman and homesick
for the world. So she wanted me to go out and get the best luck of the
gods. Mother and Father both died&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and seemed
to have forgotten his narrative in his thoughts until Julie said
quietly:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Please go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then my Uncle James came along and took me by the
shoulder, and said: &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go find our own country,
Lad!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We shipped on a vessel, and saw Russia and
Germany, Italy and France&mdash;where Uncle James said a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>man
might live master of himself but never at all could learn the tongue.
We crossed the ocean, and one night we saw against the sky a great
burning torch lifted over a new land.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Back of that torch life began. Uncle James made
money in truck gardening, and sent me to school. But still, somehow, I
hadn&rsquo;t found my place. I followed the word of the old woman of
Dublin, and finally I struck this spot. And better than anything I had
seen anywhere else, I liked what the Americans were set about to do
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;Another wanderer
called!&rdquo; she softly exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Many are called, but few are chosen,&rdquo; Barry
meditated. &ldquo;You saw one side of the Colony last night. Father
Hull could tell you about the reverse side. Others chose mighty issues
in this great time, but Father Hull took as his charge the souls of his
countrymen&mdash;to keep them up to their high engagement. For this is
a place and a time taking crude strength to survive. Rough creatures
like me are in their element. The priest has many twisted destinies
under his charge, people who have suffered and fallen. He alone knows
how to deal with them. He alone in this great rough-shod, forward
marching colony stops to gather up those who drop behind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There was Blackstone! I helped Blackstone to get
the contract for the big Santa Cruz bridge&mdash;the big thing that was
to bring the fortune he had sought for fifteen years over the two
Americas; to himself and his wife, who had waited all those years for
the Wheel to turn so she could marry him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it was Father Hull who managed to save him
from a long sentence in a native prison, when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>scandal of the adulterated cement broke forth.
Blackstone&rsquo;s lawyer was the Old Judge&mdash;a drunkard and a
&lsquo;Remittance Man,&rsquo; but in spells a tremendous lawyer. Father
Hull got him on the case, made one derelict rise up to save
another&mdash;as he did in as splendid a court scene as I have ever
witnessed. I don&rsquo;t know whether Blackstone was guilty or not,
neither does the Old Judge; but Father Hull believes in him, and
that&rsquo;s enough for all of us.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then the Old Judge, fearing the Blackstones would
starve because of the boycott put upon him, went to board with him. He
suffers torture from Mrs. Blackstone&rsquo;s cooking. I&rsquo;ve
stopped in there with him occasionally, and after one frowning survey
of the burnt, meal, the Judge usually roars for the beer which he keeps
on the ice in quantities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But most of the Old Judge must be fine!&rdquo;
Julie exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes! He was long ago pensioned off by his wealthy
wife, whose pride he had outraged, and told to seek other climates. He
has tried the wild life of the Orient for some time, but now he is
getting old and tired and lonely. He has drunk the cup to the lees, and
would turn back except for the fact that once long ago he had a
sentiment for the woman who sent him out; and this contract with her he
will respect to the end. Oh, there are any number of others,&rdquo; he
broke off. &ldquo;Ask Father Hull to tell you about them; he knows all
about that other side which I don&rsquo;t see so much of.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here we are! That&rsquo;s the Rectory just ahead.
It&rsquo;s just the neglected barren outer shell that you&rsquo;d
expect Father Hull&rsquo;s selfless spirit to dwell in. Even the old
housekeeper is a pick-up too, the relict of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>colonial who died from one of the swift
illnesses of the East and left her stranded on these shores a hopeless
incompetent whom no one else could make foot room for.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was this person who led them up the stairs to Father
Hull&rsquo;s sala, where he rose out of a long chair to greet them.
Julie was so startled by the change in his appearance that she barely
suppressed an exclamation. In some strange way his personality seemed
already to have commenced to break its moorings. To Julie, who was
particularly acute to intimations, the shadow of death seemed already
to lie upon him.</p>
<p class="par">Two other callers came up on the porch, and Barry went
out to join them. Julie sank down in a chair and regarded the priest
troubledly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to tell you how grateful I am to you for
getting me a transfer to Manila. I was so anxious to get away from
Nahal! I am inclined to believe you were right about&mdash;my not being
exactly fitted for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Things have been happening to you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">Julie smiled painfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said indulgently, &ldquo;you
are on one quest and you think you are on another. Sometime, with some
pain perhaps, it will be straightened out. But it is people like you
who help move the world. Without such there would be no human
history&mdash;just the thoughts of scholars&mdash;and priests. You see,
it takes deeper forces than personal passions to carry forward the
human pilgrimage. It took the master passion&mdash;man&rsquo;s love for
man&mdash;to lift humanity into a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He broke off, and pointed to the glimpse of the ocean
that could be seen through the spaces of the vines. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
very beautiful sunny sea, isn&rsquo;t it? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>And always I can see
the ships on it&mdash;going out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie who had been regarding him with emotion, exclaimed
tremulously, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go home? You look so
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The great calm in which he had been enfolded suddenly
broke. A fire smoldered into life above his <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3280" title="Source: suken">sunken</span> cheeks, an alert look
as at some trumpet call. He squared wearied shoulders. &ldquo;My place
is here! Some of us will never go back. We came to see it through. My
camp-fire colony, full of raw life, of struggle, of tragedy! I
couldn&rsquo;t leave it. Accoutered for the wilderness, we sit around
the flames&mdash;faces of failure, despair, and crime turned out of the
shadow of the past to the hope of the new land, where the slate is
wiped clean. It is this hour, my child, that must be watched over. A
sea of struggling humanity with heads stuck up out of the flood. In the
New Chance, the swimmer must be stronger than the current. I have been
a soldier,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I have followed hard trails. I
couldn&rsquo;t turn back now.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Odyssey of the East!&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;Life here has seethed down to its elements. The passions of men
are too dangerously on the surface, and existence is wild, swift and
sweet. Strong unbridled youth of men and beauty in a land of no
traditions or standards. Sudden wealth in prodigal untried hands;
princely Americans living so that the poor native thinks that kings
have come to dwell with him. Millions of dollars from home to run the
Treasure Islands! All magnificently, gallantly American! In conditions
like these ghosts begin to walk, and I must be here to lay them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just as you came in I was thinking of some of
these people. There&rsquo;s a lad in a bank I&rsquo;m worried
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>about. By virtue of his Americanism he thought
he was entitled to something better than a government clerkship.
Straining always toward the gilded doors of the Empire&rsquo;s elect,
he got himself made manager of this newly organized bank on precisely
the same salary he had before. But doors have opened to him, and he
spends like the rest. Some day not so far distant, I fear by the
haggard look in his face, the poor lad will vanish out of this place,
to be caught up by the secret service men in some great hostelry in
India or China to which his singed youth will gravitate. Then the long,
awful sentence in a Malay prison.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are some, you see, who were never to find
fortune in El Dorado, some who even a year ago walked these streets in
high hope and to-day lounge seedily with vacant, staring eyes, in
native booths. Then there is the ghost that is particular
damnation&mdash;native wives. Not so long ago Chad Messenger, one of
those men out there&mdash;&rdquo; He motioned toward the
door&mdash;&ldquo;married Rosalie. It is already the tragedy it was
bound to be. Chad is a high dreamer, and he ruined his life in an epic
sort of way. Rosalie has gone back to her parents, but Chad remains
nevertheless her husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo; Julie interrupted.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You can see her any morning on the Escolta,
wandering eternally among the shops. She is a great friend of your
friend Isabel Armistead&mdash;and of Orcullu. Then there was
Jerome&mdash; When he first crossed my path, he was an Infantry officer
up in the Bosque. He had drifted into playing for high stakes&mdash;a
thing prevalent over here. He was Quartermaster, and became involved in
his accounts. He would have been court-martialled if old Vincente
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>Busqua had not put a devil&rsquo;s bargain up to
him. Vincente said that if Jerome would marry Paula, his daughter, to
whom Jerome had paid some attention, he would make good the shortage,
and Jerome could quietly resign. Jerome took Paula to vindicate his
Americanism; he was never criminally guilty, I believe&mdash;some
subordinate, it is thought, took advantage of his carelessness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But good things happen once in a
while&mdash;great things. Out of the lees, a few completely emerge. A
lady whom you will meet this afternoon was one such, and her husband as
well. She is coming to see me about a charitable school she conducts.
Two abandoned drunkards, they were&mdash;he and she. Both came from
very good families back home&mdash;that thought it expedient to get
them out of the way. Colonies are always martyred that way. Ashby was a
&lsquo;Remittance Man,&rsquo; his wife when he ran across her was a
stenographer. She had taken to secret drinking long before, through a
romantic grief of her youth. Through mutual desperation they gravitated
to each other, and after their marriage they continued to go steadily,
awfully down. They became complete indigestibles in the social fabric,
and appeared to be whizzing straight through the damnation of the East,
when something happened, which I never completely understood. A
traveler through the East imbued them with some special enlightenment,
which they refer to as the &lsquo;incontrovertible truth.&rsquo; They
have tried to explain this new insight, as they call it to me, but upon
a man reared and sustained on fixed tenets, it did not take hold. You
see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;as I grow old in far strange places of
the earth, I am comforted by having fixed pillars to support my
consciousness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>Still I should like to understand what it was
that pulled these two, when they seemed so completely out of reach,
back into the safety zone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry and Chad came in from the porch, bringing with
them a man whom they presented to Julie as Doctor Braithwaite, one of
their very close friends, Barry said. Following them came the
housekeeper conducting a tall woman of slender elegance of person, who
Julie was startled to learn was Mrs. Ashby, the derelict the priest had
just been telling her about. To connect the history she had heard with
this distinguished looking gentlewoman was at first glance too
preposterous to attempt. On closer view, however, the lines of the past
appeared on the face, like a visible under-stratum which was gradually
being eroded by the force of a new mode of existence. As they shook
hands, the woman looked very attentively at Julie, as if there were
something about her that she wanted to remember.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby engaged Barry in conversation, all having, so
it seemed, a great deal to do with the matter of babies. Barry promised
to send her quantities of condensed milk.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We all beg from Barry,&rdquo; she explained to
Julie. &ldquo;But that is what he was made for; you can&rsquo;t
impoverish a spirit like his. You see, there is always an epidemic of
death among the babies over here. When they can&rsquo;t be fed
naturally at birth, they are stuffed with rice, and of course they die.
Mr. Ashby and I have a kind of school, if one might dare to call it
that, and the feeding of babies is one of the things we are trying to
teach.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A boy came in with a tray and passed cake and tea and
glasses of a light cordial. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href=
"#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you realize,&rdquo; said Chad Messenger,
speaking for the first time, &ldquo;that the first representative
government that has been convened in the East met in this city to-day
and made its bow to the onlooking Orient?&rdquo; He held up his glass.
&ldquo;To the Philippine Assembly! May it realize the fearful portents
it holds in its hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry&rsquo;s brows knit with anxiety. &ldquo;It is so
taken up with its star part on the Asian stage that it is forgetting
distressing little facts like the city&rsquo;s drainage system. A city
with bad water and worse drainage trying to lead the East!&rdquo; He
smiled dourly. &ldquo;What is all our cleaning and scouring to
accomplish if we can not get it out of the Oriental consciousness that
their vile plagues are the will of God&mdash;Isabel&rsquo;s Green God
of fate!&rdquo; He drew a long breath. &ldquo;But we will triumph, if
only we&rsquo;re allowed the time&mdash;if only we&rsquo;re not halted
in the thick of the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I insist,&rdquo; Father Hull put in, &ldquo;that
the introduction of baseball into the Islands has been Barry&rsquo;s
greatest stroke. Though he come to wear the crown of Asia, it shall not
compare to the glory of revolutionizing the native with clean universal
sport. A new national passion that is neither bloody nor bestial, and
in which all the tribes can unite.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the schools that are getting
them,&rdquo; Barry declared. &ldquo;Why, the children do compound
fractions for you before your face, sing the grandest songs about
liberty, and feed you ice-cream that they made themselves in a freezer
in the backyard. In the Straits Settlement, when I looked for schools,
they showed me usually an empty hut with a dirt floor, in which there
was no sign of pupils or teachers. That&rsquo;s the lot of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>the
tribute-paying East. Do you wonder these people think a wonder has
appeared in Asia?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashby said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;that there is just one thing that you have not
sufficiently taken into account in your plans for the Millennium,
Barry&mdash;and that is human nature. Only when the individual, each
individual comes into a complete realization of his highest estate, can
the ultimate peace and happiness of the world be secured. So few of us
are conscious of our own mysterious possibilities.&rdquo; Her glance
dwelt upon Julie. &ldquo;For example,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;can Miss
Dreschell interpret for us the unusual intimation in her own face?
There is something there of which she may be quite unconscious, yet it
is very significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry regarded Julie thoughtfully. &ldquo;I noticed
it&mdash;a year ago,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;but I find it
indefinable. It seems to be something that one merely feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby asked Julie if others had remarked this
quality, and Julie reluctantly admitted that others had. Isabel, for
example, who had called it spring magic, and the angel in the pillar of
fire, and other utterly unintelligible bits of Eastern imagery. Nobody
had ever said though, she reflected ruefully, that it would in any way
make her great.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To me it appears,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashby said,
&ldquo;to be the reflection&mdash;or the promise of great
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie glancing up found Barry&rsquo;s eyes blazing upon
her. His face wore the look it had worn that night on the roof when he
had told her about finding his city. For a moment there seemed to be
nobody but the two of them in the room, which had suddenly taken on
magic dimensions and become the medium of a whole new existence.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The voices around her brought her back to her
surroundings. She became aware of Chad&rsquo;s observation fastened
deeply upon her. When his acute examination lifted, she overheard him
say in an undertone to Mrs. Ashby: &ldquo;This quality you see in the
young lady&rsquo;s face, isn&rsquo;t it merely the transient magic of
youth and sex? Aren&rsquo;t we, particularly men, inclined to be
dazzled by the mysteries we read into a woman&rsquo;s form or face? She
herself says she has failed in all her enterprises. What is that a
promise of?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is neither youth nor sex, but something that
is as far removed from them as the stars,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashby
replied.</p>
<p class="par">Father Hull asked Barry and the other man to go across
with him to the church, to make an estimate on some repairs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashby said smilingly to
Julie, as the men went away together, &ldquo;that Barry will provide
the lumber at no cost at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As she sat there watching Julie with her kindly keen
eyes, she seemed to throw a veil of friendship around the girl, which
her senses gratefully accepted. It seemed to Julie, whose head was
aching and who had commenced to feel depressed and dispirited, that she
had known Mrs. Ashby a long time and that they understood each
other.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby asked her how old she was, and when Julie
replied, she said: &ldquo;You are very young! I wonder if there is
after all anything quite so tragic as youth. It spends its golden years
floundering about trying to find land&mdash;such a lot of floundering
it sometimes does to no purpose. It perceives nothing clearly, but
waits for the universe to clear&mdash;like a mist. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>searches in vain for the coherence of existence
that it was taught to believe in, and it comes darkly to feel that
everything on earth&mdash;and in the sky is a cruel chance. It feels
that it can&rsquo;t go on unless it can find the connection throughout
everything&mdash;and at last its poor sad little soul comes to the
conclusion that this mad chaos is not worth while.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Governor Shell told me that he had spent thirty
unproductive years of youth groping for the light. And as for me, I had
come to the end of the cosmos, and was about to drop off. Why, when
there was no clear and perfect aim in life should I waste more time in
fruitless seeking, I argued. I became so sure that life was a
collocation of meaningless realities that I felt I might as well get
myself out of it as fast as I could.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t dream that a tireless Scheme would
ceaselessly work me over until the reluctant atoms in me would begin to
work too to turn the Wheel. Mine was a black existence, that only the
worst wretches come to know; but I don&rsquo;t regret an hour of it.
Nor must you despair over any experience that comes to you, for after
this manner, my child, do we work our way into the light.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was a slacker, an idle wastrel in creation
where the Master-mind and all His minute men all over all the worlds
were battling toward the goal. I was long in realizing it. Keep
running, my friend, in the footsteps of a striving God. That&rsquo;s
what makes these men here so strong. They are battling with chaos to
bring law and harmony into a part of the world. Consciously they
don&rsquo;t know what great agents they are, any more than the
chrysalis understands why it breaks from its shell. It&rsquo;s all a
mighty subconscious unfoldment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219"
href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>of life. This business of the
East has got to be straightened out on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie leaned forward, forgetful of her pain. &ldquo;When
you and Barry talk, I step back into the old enchantment of mood.
I&rsquo;m afraid I am not struggling any more. You see, I found that
you can expend yourself fruitlessly.&rdquo; Her voice shook. &ldquo;My
mind is chaotic&mdash;just like your picture; and dark too, at times.
Ever since I left the South my convictions have been oozing out, like
sands out of an hour-glass. I meet life from moment to moment, and not
in the least understanding why it falls as it does. We are all just a
lot of ships lurching this way and that, at the wanton mercy of the
ocean; and most of us, I think, disastrously collide. The Pilot,
whoever and whatever he may be is always unchallengeable. Ah, when your
most inspired efforts have failed, when your life seems to toss beyond
your control, do you think you will find coherence in
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby&rsquo;s clear eyes penetrated through her.
&ldquo;There is coherence in the solar system, and in all the system
beyond; comets, after a thousand years reappear upon a calculated day.
There is everywhere coherence, my child, because there is everywhere
law.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what good does this law and order do me if I
can&rsquo;t find it? Down here on this tiresome planet a being called
Julie is doomed to struggle and battle and hope, and gets nowhere at
all. Oh, if only one could get up from the Game, and turn one&rsquo;s
self around for luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since it is ordained that everything must get
somewhere, you too must arrive,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashby.
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she added gently, &ldquo;if I could give you the
compass that would show you the direction!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The men were returning. &ldquo;Come and see me,&rdquo;
she adjured. &ldquo;Remember that I shall always be glad to give you
any assistance I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The priest looked white and weary as his guests took
their leave. As Chad went away in his calesa, Julie noticed that he
cast a thoughtful backward glance at her and Barry.</p>
<p class="par">Barry drove through parts of the city she had never seen
before, and which she found not so pleasing as the others. &ldquo;These
are the places we haven&rsquo;t been able to touch,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Look at this.&rdquo; He gestured up a narrow street into which
they had suddenly veered, and the aspect of which caused Julie to
recoil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This alley is very nearly the worst abomination
on earth! Chinatown! We&rsquo;re trying to uproot it, but the denizens
only make more mischief when they disperse. I have no government job,
or I would have been on their necks long ago. I&rsquo;ve never wanted
to take an official position. The Governor sends me here and there over
the islands on errands; but I want to be free&mdash;in case I&rsquo;m
needed across the water. Then too, I need money all the time, for a
million things; and I have to be free to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s eyes gazed startled at the street they
were following. &ldquo;Is China like this?&rdquo; she demanded in
horror.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t like China or Europe. It&rsquo;s
an abortive thing of both. Men become very vile when they take their
vices underground,&rdquo; Barry declared, with the resigned manner of a
god before all the evil in the world.</p>
<p class="par">It was narrow, it was dirty, it was subterraneously
vile, like pus under the surface. White men and yellow <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>men,
men of all races went here to hide their manhood in interims of
bestiality.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Animals sleep cleanly in holes,&rdquo; Barry
remarked; &ldquo;but these twists of the thing called life bury
themselves in the earth for their deeper degradation. White women have
been buried down there&mdash;live corpses; and have come forth bleached
lepers to the light. Such holes of pestilential rats have, however,
been closed up, so far as we know, and now all this evil pollutes
before the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s breath caught in a little sob before the
faces she saw. Somewhere she had dreamed of that monstrous array of
human masks; a cruel, incomprehensible evil such as one must transcend
the brute kingdom to find. It pressed a shadow down on the mind, like a
hangman&rsquo;s cap. The creatures looked at her with leers of the most
abominable intention. She sat up and stared with a white face up and
down the cursed street. And up and down it, in their yellow heads, its
subterranean minds were speculating upon her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What causes such a place?&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;There must be some accounting for such a hideous
blot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Opium, mostly; together with the incomprehensible
in man. It&rsquo;s the East at its vilest pitch, a hellish
sub-consciousness in which murder is the cleanest conception. White men
end in such places&mdash;drug-takers and drunkards, in violence
usually. Chinese pirates form the nucleus of these lees of the coast. I
could tell you true tales of them that would out-do Poe. When I first
came to the East, it used to grip at my consciousness like a black
hand. I felt in those days that my life was in peril all the time. It
used to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>worry me&mdash;till the Moros got me and led me
with three other ragged beggars along the tops of more sun-baked
craters than there are in the moon, telling us every morning as the sun
rose that it was the last one we&rsquo;d see. At first my soul just
clawed itself to pieces, but at last I walked right over some unseen
peak, and left the fear of death behind for good. That was somehow the
biggest victory I&rsquo;ve ever won.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of the nightmare now,&rdquo; he
said, as they turned in a new direction. &ldquo;Abandon hope, all ye
who enter there. The Ashbys will never cease to be a miracle to me.
They wormed their way out of this sort of thing. They used to come here
to buy the cheapest whiskey, just as others come for the dope; and
Ashby, I imagine, knows the ground floor of that hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie pressed her nails into her hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is there any place you want to go?&rdquo; Barry
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden feverish
alertness. &ldquo;Go by the markets of this district. Did it ever occur
to you that they are shaped like pavilions&mdash;that they seem to
represent one great pavilion&mdash;tented Asia, with throngs always
moving through?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know that though I try with my whole will,
I can not go into one of them? I pass them&mdash;and something always
accuses me. Ah! Don&rsquo;t go any nearer!&rdquo; she breathed, as they
approached a large market. &ldquo;The beggars in their rags always come
sweeping out. How festering with pestilence these throngs seem to
be&mdash;gangrenous, leprous, polluted. Even the heads of little
children run with sores&mdash;everywhere sores! A terrible Pavilion of
mangy and vitiated humanity, shaking with unnameable curses, and with
eyes and noses eaten away. They fill me <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>with a sinking
terror, those brown masks! They smile at me&mdash;and stare at my clean
whiteness like worms at a star. Oh! Why has the East been forgotten, in
her blindness and her monstrous sores? Think of the wars of man against
man&mdash;the great futile blood-lettings&mdash;and what their cost
might have done to banish this hobgoblinism from a part of humanity!
Nobody cares! I can&rsquo;t bear it! How can God move so slowly? Can
you see the East squatting in the dust, waiting blindly through the
ages for the Christ that shall come and stanch its running sores?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; she said agitatedly,
&ldquo;but I seem always to be passing that Pavilion and, for all the
horror of my pity, never able to go in and touch their sores. Does it
seem to you that we are like cruelly idle and indifferent gods just
looking on? Not you, but me. I can&rsquo;t get down to their
incomprehensible and unapproachable world. I want to shove them all
away out of my sight, yet all the while I&rsquo;m cursing that <i>some
one</i> doesn&rsquo;t come along and save them. Look!&rdquo; she
shuddered.</p>
<p class="par">A leper stood in the pavilion-shaped market place,
leaning like some fearful decoration against one of its posts. Large
pieces of his flesh had been eaten away. Something in his appearance
suggested that he was yet young. A human Prometheus, plucked by the
vultures of a hideous fate. His eyes lifted to them in silent
unbearable entreaty. He stretched out his hand less, it seemed, for
entreating money than for asking the mercy of God. Barry tossed him a
coin which was instantly swept up by the supplicatory crowd.</p>
<p class="par">Julie closed her eyes convulsively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
always be seeing him in the Pavilion beckoning to me&mdash;but I
can&rsquo;t go&mdash;I just can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She opened her eyes and met Barry&rsquo;s gaze in awed
silence. It was as if some unescapable burden lurked in there for their
shoulders to take.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I feel like a sleep-walker driven to the edge of
a chasm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be miserable,&rdquo; he said very
gently. &ldquo;We all live in night mostly, helpless on our little
hills, watching the eternal worlds move by and wishing we could move
our world. Look at this side of this globe! In ten thousand years while
the earth has sloughed its crust, and deserts and gardens have changed
places on it, man has undergone little change. It&rsquo;s the same
morass of human souls. Does it take ten thousand years for the human
glacier to move an inch?&rdquo; He flicked the reins restlessly,
&ldquo;Are we only picking at a cell with a pin?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And of all Asia&rsquo;s static human curse, China
is the worst,&rdquo; Julie exclaimed, &ldquo;slugs cumbering up the
earth, repudiating every metempsychosis.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! Personality is infinite in its range. I think
you will find the Chinaman adds a little to the compass of the human
soul. Do you dream that a people who chant their utterance have no
imagination, or that, because they have bowed so long to fantastic
tyrannies, they have no soul? <i>I</i> tell you that they are eating
their chains through with their teeth. I&rsquo;d give my life and my
soul if Asia would set up a republic in the face of those worm-eaten
kingdoms of Europe with their caste gradations and degradations of men,
and their empirical divisions of the land of the earth. And there is a
great hope upspringing, I believe&mdash;I know!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A pretty olive-faced woman leaned out of a passing
vehicle and looked at them. Barry raised his hat. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Chad&rsquo;s wife, Rosalie,&rdquo; he
explained.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That was a big mistake, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Julie said.</p>
<p class="par">Barry looked grave. &ldquo;Poor Chad, in one of his most
exalted moments of national chivalry, thought he was making a cementing
marriage with the East. But, as it has turned out, it seems that there
is nothing at all that he can understand about Rosalie&mdash;with her
display of adornments to the world; her laxities at home, and her
eternal super-abundance of rice powder. He took his wife, as so many do
in the East, under a veil; and now she has grown intolerable to his
Western man&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They had come out onto the Luneta, where music was
stirring through the soft dusk. Throngs of smart carriages and vehicles
of every sort were moving in slow rhythm up and down. People were
exchanging visits in the beautiful twilight. They began to stop Barry
to talk to him.</p>
<p class="par">Ellis Wilbur, nodding to Julie from under a vivid red
plume, had her carriage brought up alongside of Barry&rsquo;s trap. A
member of the Assembly came along, and Barry got out and fell into deep
discussion with him on the walk.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>triste</i> to-night!&rdquo; Ellis
said. &ldquo;The tragedy of the East has begun to fasten on me.
It&rsquo;s time to go! Do you know, as I watch the shadows fall like
slow tears over those old walls, I think what a city to be unhappy in!
A city of the East, the weight of ancient evil in its stones. The dusk
drops over it like a blackness of the heart, an infinite hopelessness.
The petals of every gay flower shrivel, and the grass grows dim. All
the forces of the night to contend against. Ah, I am sorry for all of
you who are to stay in it!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She looked closely at Julie. &ldquo;Never love in the
East. One could be sure of going completely mad in its terrible
beautiful passions, in its heavy night with the thick scents in them
and the beat of black hearts pulsing through them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know, you and I are like Janus, at the
crossroad, facing two ways; not up to going forward, not willing to go
back. And there we stand like weather-vanes, and point no man a
thoroughfare. I confess that I am too selfish and too impatient to make
an oblation of myself. Therefore, I am definitely, but not without a
certain shame, you understand, about to turn back. We are going.
Father&rsquo;s been given another job&mdash;&lsquo;in the courts of
kings.&rsquo; I was too weak to resist the prospect&rdquo;&mdash;she
gave a short laugh&mdash;&ldquo;of marrying some one princely and
distinguished on the other side of the world. And I promise you, I
shall not return here&mdash;like so many others. You&rsquo;ve seen them
in their dramatic farewells, leaving the East forever&mdash;its
corrugating problems, its intolerable hardships. And then, after
they&rsquo;re forgotten over here, they turn up on a ship, and embrace
everybody with the tears streaming down their cheeks. It was no good,
they tell you. They had to come back, and get in the game. They still
don&rsquo;t give a rip about this part of the world, its
ineffectualness and heat and hell; but what they are supremely excited
about is the Job! There wasn&rsquo;t anything to compare with it back
home. They wanted to help finish it off before the curtain was drawn,
and to help show the world how successfully Asia was being
vitalized.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ellis turned her attention to Barry, and regarded him
attentively for some time. &ldquo;Father is worried about Barry. He
thinks he is trying to break his ties <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>here. It would be
like him, of course, to move on if he found something bigger; but he is
needed here. He has a really strong influence on the people. He seems
to be the only white man they really like. But he is always trailing
off on strange errands all over the Eastern seas, and the queerest
people are always appearing to visit him. Strange conferences are held
in that house of his, I&rsquo;ll wager. I tell him,&rdquo; Ellis
laughed, &ldquo;that he must be trying to make himself Emperor of
Asia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She subsided into thought, out of which her voice broke
quietly at last. &ldquo;Does Barry McChord stir your imagination as he
does mine? It&rsquo;s only too sure that there is nobody like him among
the so-called princes of men; but he has his way marked out for
him&mdash;he must beat his way alone through this black hinterland.
Every bit of him is needed for the work. They are all agreed, you see,
that he will no more be permitted personal passions than the Pope of
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The sunset threw a golden light into the dusky cavalcade
circling about them, making it glow like a wondrous human allegory.
Suddenly solemn strains of music threw a hush over this vivid
atmosphere.</p>
<p class="par">Barry&rsquo;s head, Julie noticed, was uplifted to the
down-coming flag&mdash;which slowly descended, the symbol of infinite
things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=

<p class="par first"><span class="corr" id="xd21e3469" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Who is your guest?&rdquo; Julie demanded,
as the carriage Barry had sent after her drew up at the door of the
Archibispo Street house, where he stood waiting for her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t he I had in mind so much as
myself,&rdquo; he said gravely, assisting her out of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Strictly speaking,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the
person I sent for you to meet is a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A king!&rdquo; cried Julie with delight.
&ldquo;Where did you get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the white rajah of an island realm to
the south&mdash;an Englishman, and a fine chap. He&rsquo;s come to
return a visit I paid him, and to find out what we Americans are up to.
Ellis snatched him away as soon as she found out that he was a nobleman
in England as well as a king in the East Indies. That gave me the
chance I wanted to have a talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Delphine, his corsair hair on end, came to greet Julie,
at the top of the stairs, and to announce that luncheon was served.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be just you and I,&rdquo; Barry
said, &ldquo;and the wife of a Spanish lawyer friend of mine, who lives
across the way and who blessedly doesn&rsquo;t understand a word of
English. Later Rajah Payne, and some people who are dropping in to meet
him, will come in for tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They seated themselves at a small table near windows
filled with waving ferns. When Se&ntilde;ora Taliaferro, who was
enamored of American cooking, had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229"
href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>become engrossed with the
dishes served her, Barry leaned across to Julie and said abruptly:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sun Yat Sen has gone! He is about to start on a
long march across China&mdash;on foot through Manchuria and Mongolia,
preaching the gospel of freedom&mdash;and revolt. He begged me to go
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d get killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not on a job like that. It&rsquo;s got to come to
pass. It&rsquo;s written in the stars. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
trail carelessly off the earth and leave my job undone? Until a long
time from now&mdash;&rdquo; he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;until I&rsquo;ve
done everything I want to do, I refuse to die.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m torn two ways. Sometime I
shall join Sun Yat Sen. He needs me. But I have fires to tend here. The
flame over there was lit from here. I&rsquo;d go in a minute if I could
only feel we&rsquo;d turned the trick here; but the newspapers from
home are full of dire forebodings. An enterprise like this must be made
to sink as a fact into the consciousness of the East.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But time is passing&mdash;by the water clock of
Canton that has kept time for a thousand years!&rdquo; he murmured to
himself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he demanded suddenly, &ldquo;do I
want to share all my secrets with you? Is it because of the light of
you, that shines like a lantern in the dark of the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie dropped her eyes. &ldquo;China must be a dark
world,&rdquo; she hazarded confusedly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I used to think so! I was only a lad. The people
weren&rsquo;t people then. They were flies, hordes, multiple numbers in
the universe! And the faiths of their souls! Monstrous gods, with blood
drooling out of their man-eating jaws! Blood seemed a commonplace,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>like milk. Will I ever be able to forget that
large crude yard of the execution grounds&mdash;running with blood that
stifled the nostrils and caused me to reel with illness&mdash;human
blood, rivers of it, turning black? Terrible was the human capitulation
of that field! That submissively surrendered stream showed the Chinaman
in a new light; for not much of the blood of the Execution Grounds was
criminal. That kind could get away with bribes. It was ferociously
demanded blood of sacrifice&mdash;the blood of gophers offered to that
figment in Pekin. Why should these wet, reasonless, red spots continue
on the earth? You see that something must happen over there soon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A flat, bare, yellow, ancient land!&rdquo; he
mused. &ldquo;The saddest land I have ever seen, with little vegetation
to cover its old bones&mdash;just the stark drear plains. Isn&rsquo;t
nature brutal, to turn out millions and millions of creatures to
subsist on dead mountains and sand. And, lifting like excrescences out
of that land, the mud huts of the living mingle with the mud tombs of
the dead. Gophers in mud banks, living and dead. Nowhere else does one
ache so for man. And the intolerable sensations one experiences at
first over this monstrous dirt-like cheapness of human life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All our lives,&rdquo; Julie reflected, &ldquo;we
have looked upon ourselves as a little less than God; but over here we
are just rats crawling in and out of the universe!&rdquo; Her face
contracted in a painful spasm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put them too far down in the abyss of
your pity, though they were in the beginning a hideous phantom across
the vision of my ideals. Pekin, of course, was different. It was all
that I had dreamed of ancient and opulent Cathy: an oriental fantasy
with its great Chaldean towers, its temples and pagodas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>sparkling with sapphire lights; with its marble
courts, its flashing scarlet palaces; its grottos on lotus lakes, its
gay pailows with flapping banners, and its millions of rainbow-hued
boxes that are the dwellings of men. But, over beyond the city, cut
into the clay of the cliffs&mdash;the holes of the gophers
still!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry&rsquo;s eyes had become abstracted under his
memories.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the Forbidden City! No more to be penetrated
than heaven itself! From Coal Hill one gazed across at that shimmering
Hearsay among men, that Holy of Holies protected by walls as thick as
Babylon&rsquo;s. Over there amid legendary splendor, and unparalleled
power on earth, in high and inviolate courts to which no gopher ever
crawled, is harbored a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp&mdash;a myth, a spell,
that governs millions of gophers&rsquo; fates.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But<span class="corr" id="xd21e3522" title=
"Source: &mdash;&rdquo; ">&rdquo;&mdash;</span>he brought his hand
heavily down on the table&mdash;&ldquo;the gopher down under the ground
is eating away with his teeth the foundations of those impenetrable
places and you yet shall witness the day when he will stand up, a man
at last, in the forbidden courts of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It all sounds a fantasy of mud-caked gophers,
hobgoblins and blood!&rdquo; Julie said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen, for sometime you will see all I say come
true,&rdquo; he prophesied. &ldquo;All over the world to-day as
laborers, and down under the earth in tin mines, Chinamen are slaving
and groveling to make the money to set China free. When the hour comes,
that hoarded treasure will flow forth to turn the tide. The gophers
under the ground are stirring to resurrection. To the day,
Julie,&rdquo;&mdash;he lifted his glass&mdash;&ldquo;when the gophers
all over the world shall find the sky!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie stared at him wistfully, and suddenly the tears
rushed to her eyes&mdash;tears of awe, envy, and humility. He was in
the toils of great undertakings, sweeping on to sacred achievements,
while her sole contribution was Nahal&mdash;Nahal of dismal failure and
miscarried efforts. What was the thing that he had, and that she would
never have, that brought him fulfillment&mdash;the thing that his
friends wished to conserve and to keep her out of?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I like to think,&rdquo; she said at last, hiding
her emotion, &ldquo;that you will be invulnerable to everything that
can happen in the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why the East?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It has a separate, harder and more cruel
fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And presents greater gifts and will bring in the
end greater strength! Come!&rdquo; He rose. &ldquo;We have sat a long
time, and I hear our monarch arriving below.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell me how to speak to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We call him Sir John. In his island kingdom they
call him Rajah John. He is the second of his dynasty. The people of the
realm very charmingly invited his father to rule over them. He lives in
a stucco palace of the most monstrous taste. He would prefer to live on
his estate in England, but one must rule a kingdom whether one wants to
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; He turned round upon her suddenly.
&ldquo;I see that I should not have brought you here to-day. He is not,
and it might take only the tiniest twist of fate to-day to make you a
queen in the East. But please to remember that maybe some of the rest
of us can win kingdoms, too. I implore of you not to let that prophecy
drop out of your mind.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233"

<p class="par">Ellis Wilbur entered the sala with a pleasant faced,
deeply browned young Englishman. Upon being presented to Julie he
looked at her admiringly, which caused Ellis to cry out:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;King John has lived so long in polygamous
countries that he has imbibed their inspirations, I perceive. After
assigning me first chance at his kingdom, he is casting pleasantly
encouraging glances elsewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel, Chad, Commissioner Caples and several young
Englishmen that Barry had asked to meet his guest strolled in.
Commissioner Caples demonstrated an unpleasantly prophetic mood. The
business pulse, he said, was the sure indication of what was going to
transpire; the big concerns were withdrawing their capital from the
islands faster than ever. People who had invested in the chimera would
lose everything, for Independence was imminent.</p>
<p class="par">At this Julie saw Isabel&rsquo;s eyes blaze with
ecstasy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Great pity!&rdquo; Sir John commented.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss your Experiment to the North. I was planning
things myself&mdash;along the same lines. Tell me,&rdquo;&mdash;he
turned to address Isabel&mdash;&ldquo;what will happen to the poor
<i>tao</i>, lumbering after his <i>carabao</i> in the jungle, I say
what will become of him then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has just about as much brains as his
<i>carabao</i>,&rdquo; Isabel contemptuously flashed. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t necessary to concern oneself with a <i>carabao&rsquo;s</i>
fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you, Mrs. Armistead, that
these dumb, blinded creatures under the new impulse here have started
out on a quest for manhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The dumb and blind cannot lead a country. That
will take a great strength!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But do you, Mrs. Armistead, see that strength
anywhere about you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href=
"#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">For an instant Isabel looked to Julie like one who had
stepped suddenly into a dark room. Then the fire of her eyes flashed
across the sala.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Sir John in a whimsical
undertone. He had followed her glance to where it unconsciously
alighted. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be two white kings in the
East?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel turned from him sharply. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie moved quickly, to hide any appearance of
having heard what had so extraordinarily transpired. That flash of
words and glances had disturbed every cell of her mind. She was still
quivering when Isabel spoke at her elbow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Julie, I never saw any one who let herself be so
eaten up by things. You are as white as a ghost. Is it,&rdquo; she
turned to look more closely at Julie, &ldquo;the head again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie looked back at her, troubled. &ldquo;Oh,
yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it aches all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And have you done nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl looked embarrassed. &ldquo;The doctors might
want to open me up, to find out what is the matter. Besides, they
charge what Father Hull calls American prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Better keep away from them,&rdquo; Isabel agreed,
turning away.</p>
<p class="par">Barry&rsquo;s guests, with their tea-cups in their
hands, sauntered through the rooms, examining his collections. The
object of greatest interest was a bright red chair gleaming like coals
of fire, with in-set golden dragons.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The throne of the East!&rdquo; Ellis explained.
&ldquo;Red lacquer, glazed all over with poison, and as ancient as
Solomon. Emperors have sat in it, and the devil himself; and because of
it execution grounds have run red.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Observing Isabel staring intently at the chair,
Commissioner <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>Caples playfully remarked: &ldquo;Indeed and
you&rsquo;d look very pretty in it, my dear&mdash;with a tower of
jewels on your head and a fringe of pearls hanging down over your eyes,
so that nobody could have an inkling of what you were about. We&rsquo;d
have another splendid Dowager.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The guests drifted out to the various engagements
evening always brought. Sir John went to his room to read his
letters.</p>
<p class="par">Barry beckoned to Julie. &ldquo;There is something I
want to show you!&rdquo; All afternoon there had been in his manner the
intimation of showing his things especially to her.</p>
<p class="par">She followed him into a room, where he pointed out a
large framed picture of the Wall of China going over the mountains into
Manchuria. Instantly there sprang before her mind the vision of it
climbing in the evening light the steep foot-hills, up to the dark tops
of the mountains, where its splendid watch towers rose like a crown
against the sky.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a segment of the human mind, in
stone!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p class="par">He pointed to a gate tower set high upon the Wall.
&ldquo;The Gate of the World looking out upon Asia! It is far beyond
there that Sun Yat Sen is shortly to march afoot, secretly, on his
mission&mdash;to shake an empire. I&rsquo;d give my soul to go! For
what other life could offer a thing like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He turned on a light, and abruptly pulled out some
camphor chests. Opening them up, he tossed out their contents. Julie
dropped down on her knees and watched the rare fabrics flow forth:
lustrous brocades, and cobweb tissues, sparkling with jeweled lights.
He unlocked carved and scented ivory boxes, and chains <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>of
amethysts like drops of wine trembled out in a thin stream; then came
sapphires like blue winking eyes of the night, and a little sack of
pearls that took Julie&rsquo;s breath wholly away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Am I in Ali Baba&rsquo;s treasure cave?&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">He smiled. &ldquo;I have seen Ali Baba&rsquo;s treasure
cave, in Ceylon. There is a certain shop there which has been kept by
generations of a family. Indian princes go to Ali Sherif for their
jewels. Lots of these things I got there for prices unheard of in
Europe. When I passed through last, Ali Sherif was celebrating his
son&rsquo;s marriage. I fell to praising some of the jewels of the
native prince, and, stirred by the mood of the day, Ali invited me to
go with him into the underground vaults of his house. There on the
floors of those cellars were fabulous hills that blazed up under his
torch into every incredible kind of gleaming sun&mdash;all garnered and
stored away there by generations of jewel-smiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie picked up and held admiringly in her hand a
dazzling medallion of white jade with a single hieroglyphic carved upon
it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s supposed to be a whale of a
charm!&rdquo; Barry explained, observing her fascination.
&ldquo;Belonged to the Imperial family. I got it at the same time I got
the chair. Caples always insists that nothing short of a crime on my
part could have brought either of them into my possession; but fleeing
princes will part with anything for a chance at life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He drew a thin chain from one of the boxes, passed it
through the hole that was pierced in the piece of jade, and slipped it
around her neck. &ldquo;There you have a charm from the Lama&rsquo;s
Temple in Lhassa. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>And there isn&rsquo;t a charm in Asia to
beat its power. There&rsquo;s scarcely a Mongolian that won&rsquo;t bow
down to it. I&rsquo;ll have a catch fixed for it, and send it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie, seated among these riches, smiled up at him, to
find his whole being concentrated upon her in an intense look that
lifted her out of herself into a new personality so thrillingly
comprehensive that it seemed in touch with a world of vivid
inspirations. Bonds seemed momentarily to be cut behind her; she felt
herself slipping on wings into high areas. All about her, agitating her
soul to its depths, was this great wordless offering.</p>
<p class="par">Chad and Isabel had not left. Chad, who had a poetic
passion for oriental art, had become absorbed in some rare vases which
Barry had recently received from China. Isabel, between moments of
fitful contemplation of the red chair, stirred restlessly about,
contriving in her movements to reconnoiter along the gallery into the
adjoining room. Turning her eyes back warily upon the preoccupied Chad,
she every now and then leaned around the wall between the two doors,
and obtained glimpses of what was taking place between Barry and Julie.
Her dark head, listening acutely, was stealthily thrust forward and
withdrawn like the head of some tropical serpent.</p>
<p class="par">Chad uttered some remark, and she slipped quickly back.
He glanced up, and his gaze became transfixed with amazed repugnance.
After all, the creatures of the East were black-hearted bats, he
thought. Rosalie had been sufficiently disillusioning, but here was
Isabel&mdash;who had always stood to his mind as a racial
justification&mdash;looking like the root of all evil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; she persuaded. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">He put down the vase and followed her, but the stealth
in her movements irritated him; and when she whispered tensely for him
to look through the door toward which she was drawing him, he was
inclined to rebel. But what he saw appeared wholly to chain his
attention. He stared in silence for a moment at the two figures beyond,
then veered back with a suppressed curse.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel was breathing hard. &ldquo;You know about those
chests!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They are a fancy of his. He has
been filling them a long time&mdash;for a woman&mdash;<i>the</i> woman!
We did not want any woman to come, did we, and overturn his
existence?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He scowled. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I mean his destiny&mdash;his work,&rdquo; she
cried passionately. &ldquo;You know what I mean. Nobody must get in his
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that Barry&mdash;and that
cobweb of a girl!&rdquo; Then he muttered fiercely. &ldquo;Barry
shan&rsquo;t throw himself away too!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s wrapped up in another man. She
was about to be married to him down South, but they
quarreled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry&rsquo;s career has no place in it for any
woman&mdash;least of all for her.&rdquo; Chad seemed to be arguing with
himself, or the universe. &ldquo;Why should this moonlit wraith come
along and attempt to throw everything into an eclipse? What would he
amount to after she got into his soul?&rdquo; He appealed to Isabel:
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any way to get her out of his path?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel&rsquo;s features set into a mask.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the way!&rdquo; she repeated vehemently. She
glanced at Chad sharply to fathom how deep his meaning went.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Resurrect the other man!&rdquo; he hazarded
desperately. &ldquo;Barry shan&rsquo;t be caught in this undertow!
I&rsquo;ve prayed like a Parsee that he would keep out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that moment Barry and Julie appeared in the doorway.
The two gazed at them, wondering.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drive Miss Dreschell
home!&rdquo; Chad suddenly announced. &ldquo;She never takes the
trouble to talk to me, so I, am going to seize this chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As they drove together through the twilight, it became
clear to Julie that Chad had set himself to some psychological
investigation. She was aware that in floating into his circle of life,
she had aroused in him some inexplicable distrust.</p>
<p class="par">What he managed to evolve after a bit was that in order
that Barry should meet the peculiar hazards of his career, it was
expedient for him to remain single-hearted. Ellis Wilbur, Julie
recalled, amid her contending emotions, had said exactly the same
thing. Was everybody in the East a self-appointed guardian over
Barry&rsquo;s emotions? It gave her a feeling of being floated
persistently away from his existence.</p>
<p class="par">No, Barry must not be carried under by the current of
stressful emotions, as Chad painfully intimated he himself had been. He
contrived to make clear that what he chiefly resented in Julie was a
certain disturbingly inefficacious flame of being, which he took
occasion to compare to a light-house open to the winds of the seas.</p>
<p class="par">He did not deny, now that she was under observation, the
starry quality of her substance, but he regarded it as nothing more
than an accident of soul. Nothing ever would come from it, and Barry,
he pointed out, would be led astray by it, would follow in its futile
trail, a blind lopped-off scrap of the sun. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After a while,&rdquo; he continued, with the same
extraordinary frankness, &ldquo;after you&rsquo;ve dipped a finger in
the pie, you will go right back to the doing of endlessly
inconsequential things and Barry, perhaps you know, is committed to
going on.&rdquo; Julie understood that he referred to Barry&rsquo;s
secret activities outside the islands.</p>
<p class="par">She regarded him gloomily. &ldquo;I think you are
perfectly right in assuming that nothing I shall ever do will bear
fruit. Once I tried to pull the fire down out of the skies to light a
few little clods of earth, but the creatures only thought it was to
burn them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think you will find that you pulled down that
fire to make a halo for your own head. For all your hallowed way, you
came into the East hunting tremendous things for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie colored angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen for a long
time that you don&rsquo;t like me, but I find no justification for an
insult!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Chad&rsquo;s tone changed. &ldquo;I am not trying to do
that. It isn&rsquo;t that I dislike you&mdash;but that I wish you
hadn&rsquo;t happened.&rdquo; A tense earnestness broke out on his
harassed face. &ldquo;How can I make you understand about Barry! What
is it that fills the atmosphere here? What do you feel in the
air?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Belief&mdash;burning belief in the work,&rdquo;
Julie dejectedly replied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, but mixed up with it, as there is mixed up
in every high impulse in man, you find the darker strain. Read the mood
of this place, and in it you will find expectation&mdash;human
expectation, everywhere high. Look at Isabel, for its greatest
extravagance!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Julie agreed, &ldquo;she looks and
talks as if she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242"
name="pb242">242</a>]</span>lived in the greatest expectation of an
extraordinary climax for herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what in differing degrees they
all expect. The high, clear strain is working for the cause, and
working hard, but the dark strain is using this place as a training
ground for personal power. Take those people you met the other night at
Isabel&rsquo;s: Holborne&mdash;he&rsquo;s a prime fighter, but do you
think he&rsquo;ll not desert the field when some other background
offers to set Holborne off to better advantage? And Leah
Chamberlain&mdash;what but a play-ground of the passions is this to
her? And to Ellis Wilbur, what but a rough struggle that she
won&rsquo;t engage in, for fear of getting hurt? I could name you a lot
of others to illustrate how this priceless and incorporeal endeavor,
this Republic of the Sun&mdash;which is a movement to take hold of the
heart of the East, and not a South African or Klondike gold-fields rush
serves solely for the aggrandizement of human personalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He paused, and looked at her keenly. &ldquo;So when you
see one simple, splendid exception, you&rsquo;ve just got to hang on to
it by your teeth! Outside of Father Hull, there is just one person in
this whole Archipelago who has sought nothing, absolutely nothing for
himself. He has never had a ruling prince&rsquo;s job, though the
Government has often to go and get him when it&rsquo;s in a pinch.
Though he&rsquo;s the best known man in the Islands, he&rsquo;s never
dreamed of making himself into a political power&mdash; He&rsquo;s just
the &lsquo;Mayor of Manila&rsquo;&mdash;a wholly make-believe title,
since there&rsquo;s no such thing; but I know of no personality that by
scattering itself freely has come into such an accruement of power.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what sets him apart. That&rsquo;s
what through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>all contingencies will cause him to
survive&mdash;because neither fate nor God can get along without an
agency like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">To hide her emotion Julie looked out into the dusk.
Again Nahal, with all its eternal futility, arose like a bar to the
universe. In vain she tried to push the vision off her horizon: there,
she knew, it would stand always as the total of her spirit&rsquo;s
achievement.</p>
<p class="par">Chad went on, but with less assurance now. &ldquo;I have
heard that there is&mdash;that there might be another factor in this
thing. Perhaps it could happily be made the determining one. I refer
to&mdash;the other man. Couldn&rsquo;t he be hurried along? This is
absolutely his moment. I offer you my assistance in every way, to make
it clear to him that this is the time to step in.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie threw him a sharply amazed glance. &ldquo;Why
should Isabel have repeated that? How can you talk about things you
don&rsquo;t understand? I needn&rsquo;t answer you, of course, but I
will. The man you speak of is never coming back. Nobody but Isabel
would have dreamed of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then why sit in this dark thrall and wait for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie drew away in fresh surprise. &ldquo;Could it occur
to you that this probing might become painful?&rdquo; She put her hands
to her head. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t blame you
greatly that I reply at all.&rdquo; She lifted her head, and looked at
him with a great earnestness. &ldquo;You found out that I
was&mdash;waiting; but you didn&rsquo;t know for what. I&rsquo;ll tell
you now,&rdquo; she almost sobbed. &ldquo;I wanted to be released from
the dark, brutal spell of failure&mdash;I wanted to recapture a last
territory of my soul.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">After he had left Julie at her gate, Chad drove to
Isabel&rsquo;s house. Isabel was one of Chad&rsquo;s best friends.
Beautiful and seductive as an houri, she was surrounded in both his
mind and Barry&rsquo;s with the romance and tragedy of an unappeased
Kundry soul. Her fallen ambitions among her father&rsquo;s race touched
them. They were haunted by the cruel fact that the East alone offered a
destiny; and though she was their antagonist, they courted and admired
her. Her wild aspirations they had credited to her natural mental
opulence, and her environment. Recent events, however, were tending to
shake some of their comfortable convictions.</p>
<p class="par">The houses of the East are open, and there are no bells.
Dicky-Dicky, the dwarf, whose duty it was to stand on guard at the
stair case, was nowhere about when Chad arrived. He climbed the stairs
and, completely at home, sat down on the railing of the gallery, and
looked at the river, the view of which from this point was always
enchanting.</p>
<p class="par">A light burned in the sala, but the rest of the house
appeared to be in darkness. Isabel, no doubt, had not reached home. He
would wait for her.</p>
<p class="par">Voices from somewhere back of him floated indistinctly
at first across his thoughts. Then, as the sounds became clearer, and
arresting in their significance, his attention focused. In his long
sojourn in the islands he had picked up the use of the Tagalog dialect.
He heard an exclamation, and recognized the voice as
Isabel&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And so this pilgrimage of spells and charms, and
working upon lives, goes on, Witch of Arayat!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Chad pricked up his ears instantly. The Witch of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>Arayat had been a fantastic legend when he at
first came to the islands. From the obscurity of the years, Isabel had
evidently raised to life her spell-casting mother.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The march is long,&rdquo; a fainter voice
replied. &ldquo;First I sought the Covenant in the Golden Ark on the
Sacred Mountain. Now I seek it all over the earth. Why have you sent
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When one greatly needs, one sends for one&rsquo;s
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I gave you all when I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I sent for you to work a spell for me! I want
Paradise, my Mother. But my hands can not reach it. So I have sent for
you to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel was capable of reverting to the superstition of
her blood! To win her aspirations, whatever they might be, she had
resurrected the Charm-Woman. They were all like that. Rosalie had told
him that in order to win his love she had steadily taken magic
potions.</p>
<p class="par">The voices died down for a moment. Chad sat wondering.
He fancied he saw a tremor in the curtains that screened Isabel&rsquo;s
apartment. Two words of the droning syllables back flared audible
again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A medicine!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Chad stirred uneasily. He did not wish to hear about any
more potions. Just then from the spot where he had seen the curtains
tremble, Dicky-Dicky the dwarf emerged hurriedly and passed without
seeing him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been listening!&rdquo; Chad concluded.
Eavesdropping was a common oriental pastime; but the appearance of the
dwarf indicated that he had understood <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>something in that
interview beyond that Chad had not. What mischief were Isabel and her
mother up to? Some new political scheming, perhaps.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly Isabel, her face like a spot of darkness
against the lighted room, appeared. Chad rose startled, as if some
black whirlwind were approaching him. Here was the passion of the
Levant that he always veiled&mdash;that dreadful ravening primeval
force that assailed and overthrew his ideals. Of course, innately, he
had always expected Isabel to be like this. He knew instinctively that
she was a volcano around which they had sat in false peace.</p>
<p class="par">Something had shaken terribly Isabel&rsquo;s exotic
universe. Some secret word had come perhaps of the bursting of the
bubble&mdash;hers and Orcullu&rsquo;s. Whatever this emotion was, it
broke from deeper sources than he could divine. It took him several
moments to open his mouth in the face of it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I stopped to tell you that I have talked with the
girl, and I fear that there is no use trying to get that other man
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He paused, finding it difficult to refer to the
sensibilities of his own race. They appeared to lift like
inconsequential bubbles before this inconceivable mood.</p>
<p class="par">But that fierceness continued to make demand upon him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The affair turns out
to be merely a tryst with her own soul. But&mdash;&rdquo; He tried to
get Barry&rsquo;s name out, and failed. What he wanted to do was to
reassure their mutual fears concerning Barry, and to declare
confidently that Barry would keep clear of the complication. Instead,
he found himself edging toward the stairs while that gathering
dreadfulness followed him.</p>
<p class="par">He descended without looking behind him, but he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>could see through the back of his head
Isabel&rsquo;s image, while ahead of him Rosalie&rsquo;s rice-powdered
face seemed to wave across his path; and in that moment he thanked God
that he had never begotten children of the East. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In her school in the Tondo, Julie was required to
supervise as well as to teach. Her two native assistants, Mariana and
Clarino, however, were the two most sacerdotally devout worshipers
before the Ark of Education that she had ever seen.</p>
<p class="par">Her own class consisted of boys and girls between the
ages of fourteen and sixteen&mdash;maturity for Malays. Reports of
cholera were now steadily coming from the provinces, and Julie made it
her chief concern to impress upon her pupils the precautions they
should take to guard themselves against it. She read aloud the ominous
accounts of what was transpiring in the provincial districts, and
strove to move them to active interest. Against the River&mdash;the
lurking monster in their lives&mdash;she warned them most passionately,
and exhorted them to the point of prayer against all manner of uncooked
food.</p>
<p class="par">The answer of the ages came back to her through the
medium of these young creatures. The River had been there
always&mdash;since before Abraham. It was God&rsquo;s own river, and it
could not therefore do harm. And the things of the soil&mdash;they grew
at His will; would they then poison the sons of men? Thereupon followed
the fiat, old as time, the fiat of the God of the Pavilion: &ldquo;If
we are to die, we will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s headaches had become a serious menace. In
fact, in conjunction with the devitalizing climate, they were, she saw
with trepidation, fast sucking out her strength. She was now spending
five straight hours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249"
name="pb249">249</a>]</span>in the school-room, beginning at eight in
the morning; then, after a short interim of rest, she went to
Se&ntilde;or Sansillo&rsquo;s for the afternoon. In order to defray her
expenses and to meet her obligations, she must inexorably keep going
all the time. She could not afford to be ill: she had not one cent to
be ill with, or any one to turn to in this great awful East. Barry, she
felt, was the only creature she could lean upon; but she had a
pronounced aversion to appealing to him or to any one else. Very vivid
in her memory was the recollection of a time when, in direst trouble,
she had put out her hands and they had closed on empty space. That
experience had engendered in her a bitter resolve to stand or fall on
her own resources. Never again, she felt, would she completely trust
any one. Secretly and somberly she believed in her heart that men would
break any covenant, if they could do so without incurring the judgment
of the world.</p>
<p class="par">For some time Julie had noticed standing either in the
road or in the stall of Pietro Poro opposite her window, an old woman,
who always stared into the distance as if she were stone&mdash;with
that fashion of patience these people had when they were waiting for
something to come to pass. She was withered and darkened, as if she had
traveled through endless hot winds. She always carried in front of her
a flat basket like a tray, which was supported by a cord bound round
her head.</p>
<p class="par">When Julie asked the native teachers what the old woman
was waiting for, Mariana, the more imaginative one, replied that she
was not waiting for any one<span class="corr" id="xd21e3791" title=
"Source: .">,</span> that she was &ldquo;watching the world go
by.&rdquo; Mariana thought she was a caster of spells; but male common
sense asserted itself in Clarino, who explained that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>she
was a herb-woman. Julie had not before seen a vendor of this type, but
she remembered odd little bundles of dried leaves that had been sold as
medicine in the fairs of Nahal&mdash;for it was only at such
celebrations that Guindulman had displayed an open market. She recalled
how Gregorio used to bring these mysterious bundles home and munch at
them as a remedy for some impalpable disorganization which he professed
to feel in his gorilla-like frame. When one day she had asked him their
utility, his reply had been a vigorous pass across his vital organs and
a gustatory declaration, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Mucho bueno!</i>&rdquo;
She also knew that most of the ladies of the garrison had used a highly
efficacious soapy bark for shampooing; it had saved more than one head
of hair.</p>
<p class="par">One afternoon when Julie descended the steps, she found
the old woman at the door. She held up a small bundle, and murmured
something to Mariana and Clarino, who were behind Julie. She had said
something to the natives that put her goods in an adventurous light,
and they bent interestedly over her basket. While she flung
monosyllables at them, she looked keenly at Julie.</p>
<p class="par">Something that flashed out of her glances startled
Julie; a glimpse of a myriad of human things leaped out of this
herb-vendor&rsquo;s face as out of a well&mdash;darknesses, cruelties,
sublimities, and a kind of burning thirst, as if this old thing were a
traveler on the deserts of the universe hunting for a spring.</p>
<p class="par">Mariana and Clarino passed on, and the old woman, whose
eyes were upon Julie in their distant yet riveted gaze, spoke to her in
Spanish. She asked Julie very soberly if she knew where the Covenant
could be found. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie was stupendously amazed, but before she could
reply, the old woman went on to say that she had sought the Covenant on
the tops of high mountains and across strange lands. She said that
Julie had a light in her face that would lead to it, and that if she
would come with her they would find it together.</p>
<p class="par">A fantastic little thrill of exaltation shot through the
girl. It was the strangest, the most unaccountable, and the most
preposterous offer she had ever had made her. She smiled as she shook
her head a little pensively&mdash;the youth in her a little sad at
refusing any mystic adventure.</p>
<p class="par">The old woman was watching her. Standing in the beating
sun, her brows had contracted spasmodically.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are bad in the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie nodded. &ldquo;The sun did it, some time
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The herb-woman caught up something which she opened to
Julie in the palm of her hand. &ldquo;It will take away the
headache.&rdquo; She pressed the modicum upon the girl, in the
insistent native way. &ldquo;Try it, Se&ntilde;orita. Never has it
failed to stop pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie hesitated.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look&mdash;this I give to you to try. I give it
without payment, knowing that when you have tested it you will want
more.<span class="corr" id="xd21e3823" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s hand closed slowly over the gift. The old
woman and her basket dropped away.</p>
<p class="par">On her way home, Julie passed through the Escolta, where
Rosalie Messenger invited her into her carriage. Julie had met Rosalie
at Isabel&rsquo;s; and in the Escolta she met her casually and often,
because Julie frequently took that route home from Se&ntilde;or
Sansillo&rsquo;s, and Rosalie was always flitting restlessly up and
down the street like a tired butterfly. Rosalie usually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>stopped her carriage to take Julie in, then up
and down, the narrow ancient thoroughfare they would move, in the human
current of new and old races, before Rosalie drove her home.</p>
<p class="par">To-day Julie was more grateful than ever when Rosalie
picked her up, for the heat was fearfully oppressive. Julie dropped
back in the seat, and pressed her hands to her aching head, while
Rosalie, a tropical person who appeared to have passed through a magic
immunity at birth, craned her small head at the passers-by.</p>
<p class="par">On a corner they caught a glimpse of Barry, his tall
form lifted energetically above the heated procession, the grasp of the
colony in his face. He was visualizing, Julie thought, far-off peoples
marching under many banners beneath the sun. As they passed him, a
bitter look flashed across Rosalie&rsquo;s oriental face.</p>
<p class="par">Noticing Julie&rsquo;s attitude of discomfort, Rosalie
withdrew her attention from the street. &ldquo;The headache still? You
suffer from it always!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting so now it seldom
stops. That horrible sunstroke blistered my brain. Listen,
Rosalie&rdquo;&mdash;she sat up&mdash;&ldquo;an old woman has been
coming to my school selling herbs. She has a medicine that she says
will stop my headaches. Do you think there is anything in such
remedies? I am getting desperate; for, you see, I&rsquo;m not like you
who can drive around in a carriage all your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What was the old woman like?&rdquo; Rosalie
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, in the distance she&rsquo;s just any old
woman, but up close not like anybody at all. She seemed very anxious to
have me try the medicine&mdash;in fact, she gave me some of it to try.
Do you believe in such things?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The mestiza shifted in her seat, but did not at once
reply. At last, looking abstractedly at the horses&rsquo; glistening
backs, she said, &ldquo;There are wise old women&mdash;who effect
cures.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She says odd things.&rdquo; Julie hesitated.
&ldquo;She talked about a Covenant&mdash;and a high
mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Rosalie breathed. Then she turned
about abruptly. &ldquo;And will you try the medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you ever known people to take such
remedies?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Rosalie nodded with conviction. &ldquo;If you understood
our people, you would know that nearly all buy, and believe in them. I
have known these herb preparations to help greatly. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
they? Most of the specifics of the Pharmacop&oelig;ia grow wild
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It sounds interesting,&rdquo; Julie reflected.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try her cure, anyway. Then if I don&rsquo;t get
better, I&rsquo;ll go to a doctor&mdash;and have more debts to
pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A few days later, she stopped Rosalie&rsquo;s passing
carriage and said to her: &ldquo;I have been taking some of the old
woman&rsquo;s remedy. It really helps me. One can learn a lot from the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Delphine appeared occasionally at the school, to see his
<i lang="es">Maestra</i>; always diplomatically choosing school hours
for his visits. He reported that he was getting on very well, that the
Se&ntilde;or Barry had bought him beautiful new clothes, and that
Dicky-Dicky was his sworn friend and guardian. He was teaching the
dwarf English&mdash;out of the very books which his <i lang=
"es">Maestra</i> had used with him. Dicky-Dicky learned thirstily,
because he believed that some day this knowledge would help him out.
They talked much, Delphine said, of Nahal, and the dwarf always seemed
troubled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>about the <i lang="es">Maestra&rsquo;s</i>
treatment there, and took great satisfaction in the thought that his
sister had upheld her in her trials.</p>
<p class="par">The carelessly generous remuneration of her pupil,
Se&ntilde;or Sansillo, aroused in Julie the vision of paying off the
debt with which she had come saddled into the New World, and which had
been the source of so many of her misfortunes.</p>
<p class="par">Se&ntilde;or Sansillo lived in one of the most
pretentious mansions of the Walled City. He was a lawyer of large
interests; in fact, out of sheer adventurousness, he was interested
financially in almost every large commercial enterprise in the islands.
A large suite of rooms in the <i lang="es">entresuelo</i>, or
downstairs portion of his residence, served as his offices. These were
palatially furnished with the elaborate acquisitions of many
pilgrimages throughout the East.</p>
<p class="par">He was of a splendid family in Spain, whose
impoverishment had driven him out to seek his fortune in the colonies.
At some time or other in his history, he had been attached to the court
of a Spanish princess of the royal family, and he had a manner in
keeping with that distinction. It was the fact of his having been
forced to disclose the existence of his mestiza wife that had kept him
back, like so many others, in the arms of the tolerant East.
Se&ntilde;ora Sansillo had been one of the richest &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">hijas del pais</i>,&rdquo; and it was upon the foundation of her
wealth that his great insular fortune had been reared.</p>
<p class="par">In appearance he was the most carefully correct man
Julie had ever seen, his endless varieties of apparel all being
obtained from a famous tailor in Paris. He was tall, as sharply slender
as the blade of a knife; of almost ferocious activity, with a face on
which emotions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>seethed as in a hot lake. Among the crude,
blunt, sweating figures of the Colony, the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s
personal exquisiteness stood strangely forth. Why, in such unamenable
surroundings, he should still care to preserve this high fineness of
existence, Julie often wondered. He would step forth from his great
carriage, with its jingling silver harnessing, upon the pavement of the
crowded, heterogeneous Luneta precisely as he would have emerged upon
his favorite Boulevard. He carried this fastidious grace with him into
his business, and was actually noble in his refusal to lower even here
his &aelig;sthetic attitude. Rather than take off his coat of dignity
and get down and struggle in the dirt, however metaphorically, he would
lose any amount of money, and snap his Castilian fingers after it. That
did not mean, however, that he consistently lost in his enterprises. He
was much too brilliant and too versed in the refinements of mental
strategy for that.</p>
<p class="par">He was, Julie soon discovered, inordinately fond of
telling &ldquo;<i lang="es">anecdotas</i>.&rdquo; These recitals were
usually of a delicate double meaning, and Julie could hear his clients
in the law office adjoining her room constantly breaking into gales of
laughter. The Se&ntilde;or would appear for his lesson with the tears
of appreciation standing in his eyes. While wiping them reverently away
with a large silk handkerchief, he would assure Julie condolingly that
she had the sense of humor of a Pilgrim Father. When she could not
understand his stories in Spanish, he turned them, wickedly twinkling,
into French; and when there, happily for her, the point missed her, he
would twirl his delicate fingers toward the window and appear to beckon
the whole world into the joke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Se&ntilde;or had the Latin&rsquo;s abysmal contempt
for English&mdash;a clumsy language, he declared it, without science or
charm; and his lessons were like so many brief, reluctant plunges into
a cold bath, they were really the last thing on earth that concerned
him. English! Yes, he was resolved to learn it, but any detestable time
would answer. As there were no suitable books that Julie could find for
the instruction of adults, she brought a few from school. It was the
Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s practice, while she was trying to teach him and
while he wanted to tell stories, to pick up gingerly between thumb and
forefinger an offending First Reader that had been pored over by many a
brownie, and, shaking its leaves contemptuously, exclaim: &ldquo;Is it
within the limits of reason as conceived in your admirable head that a
grown man in complete possession of his senses can endure a thing like
this: &lsquo;The cat ate the rat: Spell <i>cat</i>, <i>rat</i>, also
<i>bat</i>, <i>hat</i>, and <i>mat</i>&rsquo;&mdash;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At four o&rsquo;clock, in deference to her Anglo-Saxon
nationality, tea would be served. It was of such an extraordinarily
reprehensible character that Julie at first had to be told what it was.
Nobody in the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s house was familiar with tea-making,
and least of all the native cook. From what Julie could gather from the
Se&ntilde;or, a handful of tea-leaves was boiled, like spinach, to pulp
and added to a mixture of condensed milk and brown sugar. The
Se&ntilde;or sipped his tiny glass of cognac and watched in wonder
while Julie heroically made away with the concoction. &ldquo;The
English are an enigmatic race,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;The Bank of
England, the bank of the world, you understand, stops work every day in
the calendar in order that every soul in it may of this fearful fluid
imbibe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Upstairs his family lived. Se&ntilde;ora Sansillo was a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>sweet-faced woman of the stout mestiza type;
dressed when she went out in screaming brocades and plumes, and when
she stayed in scarcely dressed at all. Her husband referred to her in a
respectfully disinterested way as &ldquo;Eustefa&rdquo; and as of
&ldquo;heavenly temperament.&rdquo; Why of her own free will she should
wish to be so good, he could not think. &ldquo;As for me&mdash;I am a
<i lang="es">diablo</i>!&rdquo; he would thoughtfully add, twirling his
Mephistophelian mustaches.</p>
<p class="par">His children were attractive and intelligent, but they
had upon them the indefinable Malay stamp. Alongside their
father&rsquo;s sharply defined frame, they looked as if they had
somehow been cast in wax. Children of the sun! Columbines of a tropical
garden! Sometimes Julie would see the Se&ntilde;or pick up the
youngest, a little brown will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, and after looking her
over searchingly thrust her down with an inarticulate exclamation.</p>
<p class="par">In time, the herb-woman&rsquo;s medicine seemed to have
proved for Julie to be a veritable panacea. It helped her to work and
to sleep. At night when her whole body quivered with fatigue and rivers
of weariness coursed over her frame, it was an agency of relief. It was
not only a refuge from suffering, but it was also a reserve against
over-strain; it helped her to go through the second part of the day,
which was the intolerable part. Rising from inadequate rest with the
dragging sensation of coming up out of the water with the weight of the
world about her neck, and facing the compulsion of crossing the
scorching city to battle with the intractable Se&ntilde;or, she gained
from the medicine fresh spurts of strength. Sometimes, even, she seemed
to come alive to a new world, from which armies of doubts and despairs
had fled, and which was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>invested with the rosiest plans
for her drab and clearly indeterminate future. Sometimes she rose to a
superb tolerance of mood in which mere human happenings were but
traceries on dust.</p>
<p class="par">With hard work and increasing bad health, Julie
gradually saw less of the acquaintances she had made. Isabel and Ellis
were the Empire&rsquo;s more fortunate women, claiming its brilliant
and leisurely phases, whereas she was drifting farther and farther into
insignificance. Father Hull was in Hong Kong making an attempt to
rehabilitate his health. Barry, as things were drawing to a crisis for
the Americans, was off over the Islands everywhere, striving
desperately to stir up sentiment against evacuation and feverishly
attempting to finish off some projects before the end.</p>
<p class="par">A building era had struck the centers of the Archipelago
and he was egging the natives on to materialize their aspirations. He
always came to see Julie at once upon his brief returns to Manila,
bringing with him some little trophy of the trip. They would sit
together under the fire-trees in the Reredos&rsquo; garden, with the
little flames of blossoms, lying about them in the grass while he
recounted his adventures. Other cities beautiful, he said were
springing up. Legaspi had a regular citadel of imposing public edifices
under way. San Fernando, Pampanga, had voted a splendid public square
of modern cement buildings. Solano, sepulchered dust of the
Conquistadores, was being rapidly lifted from its tomb; an earthquake
had come along and by spilling part of the ancient city had greatly
aided Orcullu in his attempt to rear a new commercial port.</p>
<p class="par">An earthquake had in fact shaken the whole archipelago;
there was a great eruptive attempt to join in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>the
march of modern progress. The Americans, Barry informed her, had made
over waterways, harbors, and cities, developed vast tracts of forest,
established new trade routes, roads, a railway, organized industries
and, in a manner of godlike benevolence never attempted at home, were
supervising the health, morals, education and welfare of the entire
race. The big things were chuggling through. One corner of the East
anyway, after a great deal of phenomenal pushing, was beginning to
stir. Imperishable cities were beginning to rear their heads, not alone
at the instigation of the Americans but at the incentive of the natives
themselves, out of whose local resources and exuberant good will, the
new cities were being built.</p>
<p class="par">While Barry pondered expansively under the fire tree,
starting up sometimes to tread the grass as if it were springs, Julie
sat quietly rapt and listened. She loved terribly these big things in
which she could have no part. She would clasp and unclasp her hands in
suppressed emotion while this splendid, transported Odysseus, his
desert face glowing like furnace gold, his great youthful frame
energizing the dusk as he moved, recited the achievements of the
Argonauts. Always there was some burning agitation in his soul. As he
walked and talked he would stir his hair wildly in his characteristic
fashion. Julie loved to watch him in moments like this, for at such
times only she was completely happy. Her soul seemed to ask for nothing
more, as if for the moment it were filled with realized dreams.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she once exclaimed, in a glory of
satisfaction. &ldquo;You never could get pinned down to the dust like
the rest of us. You could stay in this Lions&rsquo; Den forever and
come out unscathed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I did get down, remember, Julie, I should look
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because I know so much about the earth&mdash;the
hard ground floor of it? It seems somehow to have a natural affinity
for me.&rdquo; She reflected ruefully.</p>
<p class="par">He stared off a while at the starry horizon.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re agents of the inevitable. America, like
Christianity, Julie, is one of the biggest things in human history. The
two of them are victories of the soul of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Even old China,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;caught
from America the reflection of democracy. But what she gleaned sank
down crosswise into her poor old brain, and she broke out into a
muddling chaotic geyser that she misconceived as a revolt.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, howsoever muddlesomely, Asia has made a
beginning. She has kicked up, never afterwards really to settle down.
The habit of mind of ages has been thrown off. You think I am a wild
prophet, but I have read secret tumults in the souls of men that later
shall take sure shape. The underground fire will spread, and you will
some day see China break out through every crack of her blistered, old
surface. Then we shall be able to say that we have done our
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry&rsquo;s manner suddenly altered. The triumph of
his mood faded. &ldquo;Julie, the end will come here though, if these
people persist. They dare to risk so soon the human republicanism
we&rsquo;ve sweated for. In this black chaos of famine and plague they
want to stand alone. Have they forgotten the big brute bulks that
shadow this horizon? the lions and the panthers coming out of the dark
to devour them? The work of our hearts&mdash;in the dust!&rdquo; He
clenched his hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Congress will pass the Bill. It will be lights
out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>here before long&mdash;our carefully trimmed
lights. We will have to move to new beats in the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He caught her hand and walked with her to the gate,
where, turning about to face her, he said with deep emotion: &ldquo;The
cities of my heart may pass, the fires that my life has lighted die,
but you will remain in my soul the one eternally abiding
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Long after the gate had closed behind him, Julie, the
light all about her, stood pondering those words. Like a prophecy of
fire, her soul saw them&mdash;like a glowing handwriting on the walls
of fate, burning characters predicting a future&mdash;a future in which
far desert peoples were concerned, and shining human deeds. An immortal
experience was about to offer itself out of her frustrated land of
dreams.</p>
<p class="par">She felt, as she sat there alone in the moonlight, as if
she had been summoned off her futile earth to occupy a finer planet, of
Asian gardens, pervaded with an ineffable fragrance of soul. This
planet did not hold China, full of black blots; it had nothing to do
with the terrible Pavilion with leprous beggars leaning out of it.
Julie did not know what this land was or where, but it was full of the
accumulated and expurgated glories of the East.</p>
<p class="par">However Barry might succeed or fail, if his projects
collapsed at his feet or if he won heroically, he alone was wonderful,
splendid, inspired; the Excelsior man struggling upward with the banner
of humanity. He burned upon Julie&rsquo;s dreams as everything bright
and fine. She recalled the night they had first shared their virginal
dreams&mdash;before the sinister obstacle had come. Why had they been
separated to take ever widening roads of destiny? Near him she felt a
sense of tingling peace, of vivid harmony with even the unconscious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>stones, so contrasting with all the other gloomy
emotions that had warped her life. She could have gone on forever in
the atmosphere he created of fluid golden good-will. Where he was, was
always light. Even the dusk glowed preternaturally, with a promise hid.
A sense of him pervaded the garden now, its lighted lengths, its
drifting fragrance. His presence was still here, touching every
pulse.</p>
<p class="par">All about were the mates of the garden. She knew their
little dramas: the male Papaya Tree peering across in dark discomfiture
at a private little miracle&mdash;a comb of incandescent mites of
blossoms that his mate had proudly on display! The lovely lady Sun-Tree
dancing like an houri in the breeze, waving her delicate plumes and
swinging her gay bells with their hairs of tongues, while her coarse
mate, rooted by his heavy frame to the earth cursed and groaned.
Haughty, green women of the garden! They had things better than their
human sisters! Above her, pure as the heart of Mary, without ever an
earthly love in it, the white cadena trailed snowily along the walls,
while orchids quartered on fern trees watched the night with uncanny
eyes; and close at Julie&rsquo;s hand the glowing grail of the hybiscus
sadly held forth to a darkened world the blood of Christ.</p>
<p class="par">Beautiful sacred garden! If only by some magic it could
be carried on to flower forever in all the cycles of her uncertain
future! Here in this never-to-be-forgotten garden, they two had sat
with the alamanders gleaming upon them like a galaxy of golden moons,
and had proclaimed the promise of a new earth.</p>
<p class="par">For once the sense of her weakness, her inconsequence,
left her&mdash;the burdensome sense of herself as a bungling,
unsuccessful instrument of life was swept <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>out of her
consciousness by new visions. The very night shimmered with great
dreams. Glowing gates appeared to her imagination, and vast still
deserts with men waiting watchfully beneath the stars. It was that
watching and waiting that thrilled through her, caused her to start up
in wonder and awe, as if from somewhere a summons had throbbed: a
vision of far questioning places and of waiting watching men over
against the Wall that crowns Cathay. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">But if there were nights in a moonlight garden,
there were also broiling days in an equatorial city with streets hot
under foot and an atmosphere like waves of fire. Julie was moving
dizzily and heavily through life, sleeping badly, dreaming strangely,
and forgetting her food. She sat abstractedly over her meals, staring
out beyond her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is the way with you Americans!&rdquo;
Se&ntilde;or Reredo remarked. &ldquo;You burn yourselves out at once,
forgetting that it must be a slow wick and a long one that lasts in the
hot winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are ill!&rdquo; the Se&ntilde;ora would
declare. &ldquo;All the fine little bones in your face are beginning to
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was just as well, the girl thought, that the taste
for food had left her, since the fare of the Reredos was almost
completely unpalatable. Julie supplemented it at great expense in an
American restaurant. They sometimes served her <i>carabao&rsquo;s</i>
milk, and besides, during the meals, it was the habit of Chiquito, the
pig, to whimper around the table for titbits, sticking his fore-paws
beseechingly on the children&rsquo;s laps. Chiquito was a clean pig and
a very clever one, but Julie had her prejudices.</p>
<p class="par">She was forced to walk great distances through the hot
streets. Livery <i lang="es">carromatas</i> were too dear, and she
would not get into nondescript Tondo vehicles. Once in desperation she
had resolved to attempt one of these conveyances that carried the
undercurrent of the city&rsquo;s life. The rat-like remnant of a horse,
whose eyes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>begged for death, had stopped its unsteady
motion, and the coachman, the veriest dust of the streets, was
signaling the occupancy of the crazy coach, when a dreadful unconcerned
face with small-pox ulcers all over it, and a cigar stuck in the corner
of its mouth, thrust itself out at her. Death abroad on a jaunt!</p>
<p class="par">The streets with their unfathomable misery of life were
an eternal curiosity to her. It was incomprehensible that men would
take the trouble to go on breathing on such terms. Poor, tawdry, human
procession, with its occasional holiday of soul, when, like ants from
far trails, its units met and rubbed noses unintelligibly. It was good
not to be a gopher or an ant, but to be something that counted very
acutely in the universe. Gophers were born gophers, ants were born
ants&mdash;and Julies, by a comfortable decree, were born Julies. It
had all been arranged that way definitely and succinctly by thoughtful
forces and there was no use of aching over it. Gophers and ants must go
on nibbling around the careless feet of the gods. One single human
fleck of pity could not fan the East into life. It was all too big a
proposition for one ineffectual soul.</p>
<p class="par">One day walking home by a new route, she saw in the
aperture of a broken wall, a forlorn old man sitting, looking out with
half blind eyes. Poor old hermit, pondering perhaps with all the
hopelessness of the East, on To-morrow. She stopped to speak a few
words to him, and saw stretching beyond her an alley of broken turns,
between lines of battered old walls. Moved to curiosity, she followed
the alley and came suddenly upon a savage fastness, at the edge of the
sea, a hideous retreat of tattered beggars, who at the sight of the
chance invader came leaping up out of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>sand, where they had
been ferociously gambling and matching cocks, and closed about
her&mdash;a jeering, threatening crew, followed by a pack of horrible
dogs. Out of their filthy huts made of scraps of tin, boards, old rags,
nipa, more tatterdemalion creatures appeared. The dregs of the city
cornered here! On the shallows of the sea, lay a flotilla of blood-red
sails. What, horribly, did they catch in this nightmare retreat?</p>
<p class="par">Never had she seen human existence in quite so grotesque
and satirical a setting. This was not a picture of the usual native,
contentedly at sea in the universe, nor of the gophers in their sad mud
embankments, nor yet the settled evil of Chinatown, but of a crooked,
grimacing sort of corner where the indigestibles of an Eastern city
found haven. Human grotesqueries! The ordinary panorama of the
native&rsquo;s futile life was disheartening enough, but this blur of
savage hobgoblins jeering at the sun, seizing like Macbeth&rsquo;s
witches on the prey of the Alley was terrifying. She ran precipitately
back, tearing her garments from the women&rsquo;s greedy clutches, with
the howls of the Alley in her ears and their blood-red sails burning on
her brain. The horror of the East! The Pavilion of unreclaimed human
waste for which not even God cared!</p>
<p class="par">Stumbling blindly home in the sun with an aching head,
she felt that this hot cosmos into which her life had fallen was a
furnace that was going to consume her altogether. But the medicine, she
remembered, would help this miasma and dull the sick weight of the
world. She climbed upstairs, picked up a box and took a powdery pellet
from it.</p>
<p class="par">On the table lay a long, official envelope. She picked
it up abstractedly and broke it open, wondering why <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>the
red-haired man was moved to send out so many meaningless, uninspired
messages. She glanced it over, then suddenly for an instant not a thing
stirred in her. At last her breath broke out of her throat in a sob.
Another blow out of the East!</p>
<p class="par">The Department was very brief about what it had to say.
It gave no specific reason, nor did it go deeply into explanations. It
merely announced that after the end of the current month her services
would no longer be required. It took not more than a line to intimate
that the failure of her efforts in the Southern Islands was responsible
for this decision. If she desired transportation to the
States&mdash;the Department was beautifully benevolent about
this&mdash;it would arrange it at an expense to her of one hundred and
twenty-five dollars gold.</p>
<p class="par">All such savings as she had made had gone at once to
Mrs. Morris. She had no money, so what did transportation to the States
or to the moon mean to her? When she had embarked for these Islands she
had assumed the complete responsibility of herself. But to be pushed
out without a hearing at court&mdash;or a cent to depend upon! The
red-haired man had bided his time. Miss Hope who was now in Manila had
furnished him with the weapons of retaliation for that scene in his
office long ago.</p>
<p class="par">The East was trying hard to cast her out&mdash;and she
had asked only to struggle along and fumble for the end of the rainbow.
But never, never, could one be secure here. In the East, one was like a
nation trembling always on the verge of war, quivering before a
catastrophe that would surely fall. But she would not leave
it&mdash;till things had happened. She would not be driven out before
her time. She was not beaten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=
"#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>yet. She was not beaten yet. She
would not beg, nor starve, nor explain. If Nahal had done nothing else,
it had stiffened her pride. The Se&ntilde;or had several times spoken
of how useful she would be in his office in the morning to attend to
the English aspects of his practice. She could have employment from him
for the whole day.</p>
<p class="par">If they had not spoken of Nahal, if they had not
employed that particularly fatal word <i>failure</i> concerning the
work of her heart, she might have risen to give them battle. But the
Department had touched vitally and cruelly the quick of her
soul&rsquo;s pride. Nahal&mdash;the single sacred endeavor she had to
her account in the New World&mdash;had betrayed her finally and openly.
Barry, the colossus, stood with his feet on two soils; Shell held in
his grasp a savage empire; and Chad, and multitudes of others,
struggled to shape the new existence; but she, stripped of her
pretensions was blowing like a scarecrow to the winds of the East. Not
for worlds would she have had Chad know that his intuitions concerning
her, his resentment of her in his universe, had been justified. Nobody
should ever know this final humiliation&mdash;that she had been weighed
in the scales and found wanting.</p>
<p class="par">With that paper on the table her connection with the
Builders in the East had snapped like a cobweb to a star. The Great
Experiment had thrust her out. Henceforth hers was a separate lot, a
mere grubbing for existence. Julie laid her head down on the table and
wept inspired youth&rsquo;s disillusioned tears. The fragrance of the
golden jessamine floated up across the seas from that far, relinquished
kingdom of the soul. A poor, desolate and bewildered <span class="corr"
id="xd21e4029" title="Source: spirt">spirit</span> mourned <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4032" title="Source: ouside">outside</span> the gates
of its shining memories. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My island!&rdquo; The girl wept after its
vanishing outline.</p>
<p class="par">But Julie knew that, though she might bid Nahal farewell
forever, it would still remain an abiding obstacle of soul&mdash;a dark
enigma lying heavily across her life.</p>
<p class="par">The Se&ntilde;or was completely satisfied with the new
arrangement whereby she gave her whole time to his service. He was the
only person with whom she was wholly candid concerning her break with
the Educational Department.</p>
<p class="par">Barry, she found hard to satisfy with explanations on
this score. She confessed to him that for a long time she had owed a
large debt which had ridden her back like a nightmare, that expenses
were too high to save anything on her salary and that the
Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s emolument was in excess of anything that she could
expect elsewhere. He looked at her hard but said nothing. His silence
troubled Julie at night. She knew that he was disturbed that she should
have abandoned even her small part of the Cause, which in these days
was in urgent need of the whole strength of its adherents.</p>
<p class="par">His own business affairs she knew were disintegrating.
People said he had been losing money for some time. But he stuck to
what now commenced to appear as a losing cause. Julie thought miserably
of the time when he would cease to appear in the character of a prince
of the East. He was grappling now with tremendous forces at home and
abroad. The agitation for independence for the Islands surmounted for
the moment every other national concern. The natives awaited almost
hourly its promulgation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re six thousand miles away&mdash;in the
other half <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>of the globe, and they can&rsquo;t visualize our
problems. They don&rsquo;t understand that they must hold this thing
off far a while. The whole course of history will be changed. Oh, if
they could have one &lsquo;look see&rsquo; into the Pavilion, Julie! or
one glimpse at the holy foundations of the new Asia! I tell you I
can&rsquo;t bear to see this project cut adrift in the universe alone.
Ah, well, I&rsquo;ll be going to China soon, and I promise you
I&rsquo;ll raise every foot of its ancient dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie adored Barry in his spurts of white wrath, but he
was wretched now as well as angry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cleopatra&rsquo;s barge will not stay afloat. It
will sink with its Eurasian captains in Eastern seas!&rdquo; Julie
prophesied.</p>
<p class="par">He glanced up quickly. &ldquo;Isabel!&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;She must be in a fine frame of mind. Perhaps the
grandiose title we gave her may yet come true. Republics over here will
be sadly unsteady things. A strong hand can too easily twist them into
the one-man power the East understands. It&rsquo;s the effect on China
I fear the most. She was drawing life and encouragement from this
experiment, and just at the crucial moment the whole thing with its far
reaching results, is about to topple into dust!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The day is near,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;when
we must pick tip our packs and move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie tried to realize it, tried to plan toward such an
eventuality, but a spiritual as well as a physical inertia enveloped
her like a super-added sheath of being. She exerted herself to the
utmost to hide this new condition from his observation for she knew in
what a desperate struggle he was engaged for the life of the New East.
More than any personal emotion that could ever seize him, she believed,
this passion gripped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>his heart. And for one who had achieved
nothing in this issue, who had actually been flung out of all its
purposes, no legitimate appeal remained. Her dazed being still
responded acutely to all his problems&mdash;but the greatest of them
all had left an agony in her soul.</p>
<p class="par">Once he looked at her very troubled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter, Julie?&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p class="par">And Julie seeing that in that moment he had forgotten
everything but her, grew frightened in spite of her exultation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just the effects of the
sunstroke!&rdquo; she exclaimed, drawing herself defensively up.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to see Braithwaite,&rdquo; he
said. But he was summoned away on another of his critical errands, and
the visit to Dr. Braithwaite did not take place.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless Julie was stirred to concern by the
abnormal agitations within herself. She scrutinized herself in the
glass one day, and was startled by what she saw. The delicate outlines
of her face, which looked like sculptured crystal, reflected a
disturbing inner ravage. Under her lower lip a singular bluish shadow,
which for some time had been dimly suggested, had become definitely
marked, as if some menacing malady were revealing its first sign.</p>
<p class="par">She was puzzled and a little alarmed. She resolved to go
and see a doctor, only to remember that in her present unstable state
she dared not risk the complication of the cost. She consoled herself
with the thought that if she were really ill more malevolent symptoms
than these would have declared themselves.</p>
<p class="par">Her mind skirted lightly an under-current speculation
concerning the medicine she had been taking. Because it had become so
indispensable, she did not actually attempt closely to question it. It
was unquestionably, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272"
name="pb272">272</a>]</span>peculiarly and irregularly derived; but it
certainly was not poison, as her use of it had proved. And it did work;
it took pain away;&mdash;whatever abnormal after-agitations it might
produce&mdash;and just now that was what overwhelmingly counted. Back
of that fact she was not disposed to go. Rosalie had been perfectly
right when she said that a large part of the valuable drugs of the
world were to be found wild here. Julie herself had walked through
pungent jungles and forests and felt that she was traversing some
universal pharmacop&oelig;ia. The natives of Nahal through the use of
herbs, which were the only medicinal aids at their disposal, had
learned how to exist quite without doctors. Julie had a consciousness
that clung to any sort of panacea. She manifested always an inability
to stand upon her own spiritual powers. This particular panacea, she
was however aware, had caught upon some vital fiber. On blistering days
when the heat hung in the air like a stifling blanket and all the
forces of her being refused to go on, the old crone&rsquo;s nostrum
dropped a soothing veil over her blinded, quivering senses and freed
her awhile from her intolerable burden.</p>
<p class="par">It helped also in another struggle, the struggle to keep
from understanding, as the days passed in the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s
office, why her services were so valuable to a pupil who paid so high a
price to make no progress at all. Subconsciously she had sensed for a
long time at what this artistically indirect method aimed. As the
Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s vocabulary of gallantry began to come out more
clearly from behind its Spanish ambush, the girl sometimes felt as if
she were hanging by a hair over a precipice. She cursed devoutly her
knowledge of French; for though she pretended not to understand,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>the translation would too often come out on her
burning face. She dared not be angry; she could not revolt: were not
her last bridges cut behind her? Between her and the most desperate
extremity, this situation alone interposed. This slow, creeping
Spaniard was the rope on which she must balance across the cataract. So
when opulent emerald rings and rare rubies were discovered lying
casually upon her desk&mdash;for her to admire&mdash;and were waved
back silently upon her when she tried aghast, to return them to their
owner, she could only employ the foolish subtlety of remarking how much
Se&ntilde;ora Sansillo would appreciate these intended gifts of her
thoughtful husband.</p>
<p class="par">It was a silly strategy, executed by a crude man in the
crudest way. There was no spirit in it; the lovely stones stood for
nothing but an ignorant man&rsquo;s misapprehension of the human soul.
It would have been laughable to the girl had she been in other than a
desperate plight. Nor could she laugh at anything that caused her so to
despise herself, her own ignoble clinging to such a rope of life.</p>
<p class="par">But she would not retreat from her individual stand.
Barry alas, had troubles enough now. And this place, which had
monstrously and unjustly, and without a hearing, cast her out, should
receive no appeals from her. One must make a final stand on one&rsquo;s
own in this shattering world&mdash;and not if she were to die to-morrow
would she come out and declare her failure. She was still desperately,
so she conceived, the mistress of her own fate.</p>
<p class="par">Then at the climax of these over-head emotions, would
come an engulfing ennui, as if all this stir were but an eternal
pouring of water through a sieve. To keep alive in this fearful foreign
whirlpool, one had to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>struggle every instant. Something
seemed to be thrusting her gradually toward the edge of a dark and
fatal pool, and there was creeping over her an appalling weariness of
life.</p>
<p class="par">One day she received word that Isabel wished to see her.
She had not seen Isabel for some time. After having been discarded from
the real life of this colony and forced to her present anomalous mode
of livelihood, she shrank from encounter with the brilliantly
successful ones whose rival she had once essayed to be. As the outcast
from the Great Project that Chad had predicted she would become, her
despair at seeing those who had entered the race when she had, became
sometimes more than she could combat. The wretched queerness of her
being lately had made her morbidly acute.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel most of all had seemed to press this superior
fortune pitilessly upon her, had even, so the girl thought,
demonstrated a hint of hatred on their meetings. This thought troubled
Julie; but she could not bring herself to ignore the summons, for not
only had Isabel&rsquo;s friendship more than once been turned to
account, but Isabel sending for her in this unexplained way, showed
that she had something vital to say. Out of this infinite restlessness
Julie wondered, as she set out for the house of the caliphs, what was
to develop.</p>
<p class="par">Everything appeared unchanged. The old keeper, with the
withered face like a Chinese nut, who had told her the first time she
had seen the place that this was the dwelling of a &ldquo;daughter of
the country,&rdquo; came forth from his lodge and ushered Julie into
Isabel&rsquo;s domain. Absolute stillness pervaded the house. The
dwarf, who had watched her acutely as he conducted her up the stairs,
disappeared. The pensiveness and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275"
href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>inertia of the tropical
afternoon had fallen like a sad mood over the exotic world. Julie
looked about her and sighed. She felt a desire to get out of this
ageless Asian splendor down into the sun of the street. To-day the teak
wood called up visions of distant sweating bodies. The shining dark
floors stretched like black waters beneath the feet; the heavy golden
curtains stirred as under Indian magic; and the ivory Buddhas dozed in
a changeless Nirvana. Perfume hung in the air: the smell of myrrh and
aloes and cassia out of ivory palaces, mixed with the odors of dying
flowers. Back in the next room, in a corner where she could just
glimpse it, was the gilt shrine of the Green God, who from time
immemorial had inspired in the hearts of men the fear of fate.</p>
<p class="par">Abruptly at an invisible warning, Julie&rsquo;s eyes
swerved sharply. A sinister brown face gleaming like an evil star from
a chaotic mass of black hair appeared half concealed among the potted
palms. Julie rose almost defensively.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Isabel!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with a tremulous
voice. She did not wish this changeling, who could assume at will the
soul of either of two races, to see how disturbed she was.</p>
<p class="par">The Malay woman bore down upon her in stormy
silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time,&rdquo;
Julie said, agitatedly casting about her for a means to meet this mood.
&ldquo;I lead a hard, busy life.&rdquo; She spoke of the difficulty of
her existence as if the fact of it might somehow appease Isabel, who
drew nearer and fixed upon Julie a gloomy concentration.</p>
<p class="par">There was something almost thirst-like in this
examination. Isabel appeared to be straining for something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>that
lay beyond the girl&rsquo;s own consciousness. The sun had given Julie
a glow of color, and when she essayed to smile the old miracle of look
transfigured her like a sudden star lighting brightly the weariness of
earth. Isabel waved a demolishing hand before it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Futile, futile flame! I knew it would burn itself
out. You want me to believe,&rdquo; she went on fiercely, &ldquo;that
you are in a deep struggle&mdash;that you are giving your soul to be
ground up for some fine cause. But you can&rsquo;t deceive me. I know
that you are a malingerer&mdash;and that, whoever&rsquo;s bones may be
broken by the wheels, they will assuredly not be yours. In the vigil,
the peril, the anguish of this fool&rsquo;s dream, you have had no
part. You have sat and waited&mdash;like an imbecile sphinx&mdash;for
something to come along and solve your foolish riddle. The very stars
have sung in your ears, and you have not heard. Nothing has touched
you&mdash;nothing can!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In sullen challenge, she swept on. &ldquo;Why were you
not content with your little hillcock, and your wretch of a man-ant?
Why have you to stretch out your foolish disastrous hands to pull a
world to pieces? You know,&rdquo; she rushed on, fiercely, &ldquo;that
our friend Barry along with the rest of them&mdash;stands on the brink
of complete catastrophe; that the great structure he believed he had
created is about to fall about his head; you know too what the love of
these things is to him&mdash;yet you thrust yourself between him and a
single saving chance; you who could blow away out of the world like a
feather, without consequence to any one! It is always exasperatingly
weak things like you who plant their feet in the course of fate. I have
sent for you to tell you that you had better take yourself out of the
way.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie stared with a beating heart at this being to whom
she was as a kindling to a flame.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by my being in
the way,&rdquo; she stammered weakly. Isabel stood somberly glaring at
her. What was in this woman&rsquo;s mind? What was it all about? Her
eyes turned to escape this dark distorted vision, and ran along the
wall&rsquo;s stream with an armory of poisoned weapons, each of which
was forged to deal death in a particularly monstrous way.</p>
<p class="par">Her mind struggling with its fears caught at the vague
intimation of hope for Barry in Isabel&rsquo;s wild utterances.
&ldquo;Oh, do you mean that he could be saved&mdash;out of the wreck?
You could do it, Isabel, of course. Oh, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she pleaded
desperately, &ldquo;let him be driven out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think you have to plead with me, you
little wastrel? The East will requite those who truly give themselves
to it. There will be a place in it for Barry&mdash;but there will never
be any place for you&mdash;that is what I want you to understand. When
the hour comes to requite him, I warn you not to intervene.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s spirit asserted itself. &ldquo;What is
going to happen to him?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel flung at her a contemptuous glance, and exclaimed
in a sudden abandon of revelation: &ldquo;The finest thing that ever
happened to a white man in the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl&rsquo;s head sank. Upon her memory had flashed
the new portentous words exchanged in Barry&rsquo;s house between
Isabel and the white Rajah of Ramook. Her whole being felt suddenly
borne down. Her lips slowly paled; the light swept out of her face,
leaving it a chill, ghastly white. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Isabel strained forward, her eyes riveted on the blue
blur which stood out now under the girl&rsquo;s lips.
&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;&rdquo; she said, and sank back, while Julie moved
unsteadily to the stairs.</p>
<p class="par">She went through the down-dropping dusk of the garden,
in utter hopelessness of mood. The choice of the starry ways cut off
forever. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Barry hurriedly presented himself one afternoon at
the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s offices. Father Hull was fatally ill, and
Barry had come to get Julie.</p>
<p class="par">Outside the priest&rsquo;s room, in the Military
Hospital, they found a hushed motley assemblage&mdash;officials of high
standing, prominent natives and poor ones, many of those Father Hull
had called his camp-fire colony, grouped there waiting for news. A
nurse flitted occasionally in and out; in those days of over-crowded
hospitals, nurses were forced to disseminate their administrations.</p>
<p class="par">Barry and Julie stepped softly into the room where the
priest&rsquo;s emaciated form lay stretched upon a bed. They bent down,
and watched tremulously for his fluttering breath. The stern,
make-shift surroundings, the absence of any one near to him, brought
the tears to Julie&rsquo;s eyes. While she had been giving all her
thoughts to herself and her own vicissitudes, the priest had hung on
his cross suffering. His outstretched wasted arms seemed to be offering
the final oblation of life. He was going out after a hard march. The
camp fires were dying, and he who had urged the souls of men along
rough trails was being extinguished with them.</p>
<p class="par">His eyes opened feebly and rested on the door. Some yet
living sense that stood on guard over his earthly mission must have
affected this flickering return. His lips moved urgently. Julie
understood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>that before he slipped out there was some token
his spirit wished to pass to his colonist children. She tiptoed to the
door and summoned them in.</p>
<p class="par">As they entered, the priest turned upon them the
helpless solicitude of a dying father. He was leaving in their
faltering hands their unguarded destinies. The old Judge grasped his
inert hand in helpless sadness, murmuring under his breath something
about &ldquo;giving it up for good.&rdquo; The Blackstones, shabby and
broken, held up a thin frightened baby before his glazing eyes.
Jerome&rsquo;s somber, worn, dissipated face worked with emotion. Mrs.
Abernathy wept softly at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p class="par">But it was to the shining serenity of the Ashbys that
the priest turned for his last vision of life. He kept his eyes fixed
upon them, as if, in this final extremity, they helped.</p>
<p class="par">Julie glanced curiously at Mrs. Ashby, who now stood
beside Father Hull holding one of his hands. Her lids, drooped
downward, appeared closed. By her blank outer aspect the girl knew that
she was withdrawn into some mammoth struggle. It seemed to vibrate
about her in excitations of the atmosphere, as if an atom sought to
stir all space. &ldquo;She is trying to save him,&rdquo; Julie
thought.</p>
<p class="par">There should of course be a way to do it. Death was a
mistake that had crept into creation. That was shown by the fact that
never yet in all the eons had man accepted it naturally. Life itself,
in its sundering battles, had perhaps evolved this malevolence, which
darkened the whole universe. Never had she looked on this irremediable
mystery without experiencing an insensate revolt and an unaccountable
conviction of its unnecessariness. She looked around <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>at
this circle of wretched human helplessness, at the supreme helplessness
on the bed, and felt unreasonably that they had still not turned the
last stone.</p>
<p class="par">She turned to Mrs. Ashby to see if she might
unaccountably have demonstrated an answer to the struggling things
within her mind. But she too had clearly only grazed the great
secret&mdash;for the priest suddenly was dead. Over the city that he
had left forever, the sunset gun boomed.</p>
<p class="par">In a silence that weighed like lead, Julie and Barry
rode home. Julie broke it at last. &ldquo;He should not have
gone!&rdquo; Then to the dusk she murmured absently and fragmentarily:
&ldquo;The things I do&mdash;ye shall do also!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you saying, Julie?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One Person solved the mystery, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He stared at her blankly. Then she roused herself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unnecessary&mdash;this dying,&rdquo; she broke
out.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In this instance criminal. A filthy disease to
conquer so great a human force!&rdquo; Barry declared with bitter
passion. &ldquo;If death didn&rsquo;t break one&rsquo;s heart, it would
make one insane with anger. He had good doctors, too,&rdquo; he
reflected gloomily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But doctors can only go so far. Then you strike
the dark border where unfathomable mystery lies; the door-step of the
unknown, where accident, chance, the turn of a hair&mdash;and, yes,
miracle intervenes. Nobody can penetrate there. If only one
could!&rdquo; She leaned earnestly toward him, the light coming into
her face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he meditated gently, &ldquo;all life
hangs on a miracle. Yet,&rdquo; he exclaimed somberly, &ldquo;I think
he is to be envied in passing out before the great
d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. You couldn&rsquo;t have turned his footsteps from
these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>shores, and he couldn&rsquo;t have borne to sit
among the ashes of such big hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie had never seen Barry look so worried, as if a blow
had been struck across a vital part of him. Other people were always
weary in spots, or altogether; but he had been undaunted in harness,
campaigning joyously against the obstacles of the East. Soul-stirring,
world-overturning Barry, who had set his tireless shoulder to every
load! His heart must not break!</p>
<p class="par">Often lately in their evening drives over a
moon-enchanted city, a city with all her sad secrets hid and along the
great ocean lying like a sector of eternity against poetically silvered
mortal shores, she had seen him strain about and look over it all and
sink back with a bitter sigh. She had read all the heaviness that lay
in his soul at these times.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say, and I will continue to say to my last
breath, that we were winning Asia step by step. Over in China, they are
beginning to strew the dynamite that will blow the old order of things
off the globe. It makes me too angry to speak of it! And I ask you,
Julie, if the Gods have given me a square deal? Isabel&rsquo;s Green
God will win the day, curse him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie looked at him searchingly. &ldquo;Isabel is a
great friend of yours, isn&rsquo;t she, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She works against me, and tries to upset
everything I do; but she still manages to convey the intimation that
she means well toward me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what do you think she finally does mean
towards you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Barry glanced up wonderingly. &ldquo;She is an old
friend of mine, and does not want, I imagine, the best of her
friendships broken. In a way, you can scarcely blame her for seeing
things as she does.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href=
"#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She is beautiful&mdash;very!&rdquo; Julie added,
with a trifle of severity toward herself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She is justly the Queen of the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; the girl broke out feverishly,
&ldquo;she should find something splendid to offer you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is no splendor left to me here, that I can
conceive of.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But if you could still serve in the
East&mdash;would you do it&mdash;at all hazards?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will serve the East till I die,&rdquo; he said
between set teeth. &ldquo;It may revile me, trample on me, repudiate me
altogether, but it shall not, I say, utterly cast me out&mdash;as this
place is about to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He looked at her in despair. &ldquo;The cholera is in
the city, Julie. A just judgment on the blind. Lord God of Hosts, after
our labor and sweat, the eternal plague! It seems to have broken out in
nearly every province; and if it keeps on at this gait, it will rot the
Archipelago. It looks like a holocaust this time, to sweep away this
blind beggars&rsquo; caravan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Peste!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t heard that wail of the lost over the devastation of their
little lives, as I have, nor walked at sunset through the blood-red
light into their poor hamlets and found them dying darkly behind their
rush walls, with the fiat of God written on their foreheads, as
they&rsquo;d say. Isn&rsquo;t that the human soul of
it&mdash;conceiving the curse that its blindness has brought down upon
it to be a splendid decree of God? If a thousand years were as a
day&mdash;as they are to Him&mdash;we&rsquo;d win over here. But look
at these creatures now, tearing everything away, and shouting out
across the seas that they can stand alone, their bewildered souls on
their splendid feet!&rdquo; Barry relapsed into his native idiom, as he
often did when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>he was greatly stirred. &ldquo;And here they are
at last in the power of the Plague, with their splendid feet a-fleeing,
and their bewildered souls going out to God, who never asked for them
in such a hurry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the soul-splitting East! You may
take its highways barefooted, your veins bleeding all over them at
every step, you may hand its people from a high mountain the kingdom of
God, but they&rsquo;ll never be caring a bit. It&rsquo;s not in the
nature of any of them to give thanks to God or man. Sometime far hence,
when I&rsquo;m through with the East and wish to go up into a cloud to
rest my soul of it, they may try to persuade me down with a mountain of
gold, but I&rsquo;ll kick the whole thing over and go on my way
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He dropped his fervent fantasies, and fixed upon her a
passion of solicitude. &ldquo;Take care of yourself, Julie, mind! You
have a shining bit of light on you that I never saw on another mortal
woman&mdash;and which will hold me through all the dark places I shall
pass through. What does it matter whom else they say you are waiting
for! Never, to the end of time, will I believe the soul of you stands
waiting for another man! In all these days, when my heart has been
going out to you, you&rsquo;ve had this will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp in your
brain. It can&rsquo;t be anything more&mdash;just a screen down the
path, hiding for a little while the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; Julie asked, turning white in
amazement, &ldquo;told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Chad and Isabel&mdash;my friends who do not see
your fairy light. They want me to let you pass on&mdash;as though I
wouldn&rsquo;t go on following after you across all the tracks of the
universe!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Often the portals of her spirit had started to
spring&mdash;to loosen her imprisoned emotion, but the conviction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>of her unworthiness, the fear of mischievously
or malignantly encroaching upon his life, had dammed it back. Sometimes
even in her despair, she had felt that his eyes were looking for
something the confines of her gates did not contain. Now, almost
overpoweringly the impulse to disregard the consequences, to fling open
her soul, to disemburden it to the bottom on that instant of all the
pain that had habitation there, flared up in Julie. The very citadel of
her soul had been struck.</p>
<p class="par">Then sweeping over her again came all that Isabel had
said&mdash;the terrible, almost inconceivably terrible calamities she
had threatened. Once more she remembered the prophetic flash of look
between Isabel and the Rajah of Ramook&mdash;the <i>king</i> of Ramook!
after independence Barry was to have a high place&mdash;the highest
they had to give, perhaps. She swept out her hands distressfully, as if
to clear away this mammoth bewilderment. Suddenly she found resolve,
even with the suppressed tears choking her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Chad and Isabel are right!&rdquo; she declared
huskily. &ldquo;I am not fit to come in your path&mdash;not at all
worthy of ideals and energies like yours. Chad said I was a
wastrel&mdash;and so did she. The woman who should touch your life,
Chad said, should be one of concentrated fine forces. I have never
concentrated anything. I have moments of inspiration, moods of fervor,
but never have they&mdash;never perhaps will they knit into anything
abiding. I tried in Nahal. I gave it the best in the compass of my
being. If anything was to be fulfilled, it would have been fulfilled
there. Nahal was my Chance. I can&rsquo;t think why it turned out as it
did&mdash;I wonder if I shall ever know. My catastrophes there have
made me stagnant. You see, everything <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>mattered so terribly
then. I was red-hot iron to be struck to any shape of the future. I
couldn&rsquo;t make you understand&mdash;not even by opening up a whole
train of luckless experiences and abasing myself in the telling of
them. Sometime, perhaps, a reckoning will come.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why did I have to go South&mdash;after we had met
that night on the roof! That is when our spirits really met. But
something took me on and on in another direction. Perhaps I
wouldn&rsquo;t have been&mdash;I&mdash;the sum of me&mdash;without all
that has come to pass. I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is going to
be. I won&rsquo;t be a marsh light to you, luring you along false
paths&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t bear, Barry, dear&rdquo;&mdash;her voice
broke&mdash;&ldquo;to have you desert me altogether. Go on holding me
in your thoughts!&rdquo; she entreated with a little sob.</p>
<p class="par">The sight of his bowed shoulders and hopeless face
overwhelmed her. Atlas crushed under his load, struggling tragically
against destruction.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything to save you, Barry!&rdquo;
she cried, clinging wildly to him. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t drop down.
Something is going to happen to you. Some one is going to help you
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After he had left her at the Reredos&rsquo; gate, the
universe seemed to have widened fatefully between them, leaving her
alone&mdash;all alone, in fearsome areas of space. She crept up the
stairs to her room. But not even the medicine brought her any sleep
that night; never had her being been so hideously disturbed. Isabel had
promised mysteriously tremendous things, for the fruition of which she
had been ordered out of the way. Everybody was ordering her out of the
way. Out of the vague plots that seemed everywhere <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>about her, but one thing emerged, but one thing
counted&mdash;the possibility of a turn in Barry&rsquo;s fortune.</p>
<p class="par">If the Islands should now become independent before they
were prepared, almost anything might come to pass. There was a leaven
in men&rsquo;s thoughts, Barry had said, that was bound to turn things
frightfully about. Humanity was urging on to the pass where it would
accept the most portentous challenges of fate: the old structure of its
existence, handed down through the ages, would no longer answer for the
framework of men&rsquo;s lives. Dissatisfied with the ancient edifice,
it would overthrow the world, and rear a new. &ldquo;A new heaven and a
new earth, my dear, for these blind human bats is on the way,&rdquo;
Barry was wont to declare. Barry&rsquo;s enthusiastic fancy was fired
by this magnificent mood, which he claimed to discern all over the
earth. There would be an explosion, of course, to blow away a lot of
medi&aelig;val rot&mdash;and there would be loss of life: to get the
message of the stars, one had to bleed. They could have his
life&mdash;oh, yes, a dozen of them. He had flung away a dozen
impossible lives with an indifferent Olympian wave.</p>
<p class="par">Which all went to prove to Julie&rsquo;s mind that
Isabel&rsquo;s speculations might not prove so startling, after all.
Well, if through the instrument of Isabel&rsquo;s uncertain hands, his
dream could be saved, nobody at all must stand in the
way&mdash;certainly not a mere Julie with her knotted web of life. But
how was one to make sure of the vivid, veiled Isabel?</p>
<p class="par">At dawn, Julie rose, and dressed feverishly. She
summoned a <i lang="es">carromata</i>, and set out in an agitation of
anxieties for Santa Ana. Mrs. Ashby had told her to seek her out when
she was in trouble. Everybody <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288"
href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>was in trouble now; not one
in these stressful times knew where to turn; Julie herself, least of
all. Mrs. Ashby had managed to convey to her the intimation of a
certain exceptional strength, which she now felt a desire to draw upon
for extrication from her difficulties.</p>
<p class="par">The Ashbys inhabited&mdash;that being a term for the
state of life which they shared under the same roof with a community of
other people&mdash;a large Spanish house not far from the river. The
surrounding fields, enriched by the stream, looked in the distance like
the work of an impressionistic artist rather than of an orderly nature.
The house stood alone, sunk in the lush depths of the rice fields,
where workers picturesquely clad in red in a seemingly jocose attempt
to terrorize the birds, were cutting the young rice to the music of a
rough guitar plied by a recumbent artist under a huge umbrella. The
house itself, painted green, jutted out of the surroundings, of a piece
with them.</p>
<p class="par">The institution was called the Free School of Practical
Arts&mdash;the words &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;arts&rdquo; making a
direct appeal to the native, whose graceful inclination of mind
construes freedom as leisure, and Art as a casual expression of
leisure.</p>
<p class="par">The principal instruction was concerned with the habits
of civilized living and thinking. The male aspirants were taught to
design furniture and join it, to care properly for the universally
abused domestic animals, to farm, to tailor their own garments, to
construct simple <i>nipa</i> houses, and to practice sanitation. The
girls and women were taught to manipulate the native stove to better
and more varied methods of cooking, to do sewing, and to make fine
embroidery&mdash;from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>which industry, as well as from
the bureau of domestic employment in connection with which house
servants were trained, was derived some revenue. The care and feeding
of infants, whose mortality in these parts was startling, had also an
important place in their instruction.</p>
<p class="par">As Julie entered, she was struck by the happy and
trustful atmosphere of the place. Mr. Ashby&rsquo;s spectacled eyes
lifted to her from the planing of some boards. A flock of keen,
merry-eyed boys, let loose from concentration, burst argumentatively
into English about the work in hand. Just at the present moment back in
the city, her own former pupils, Julie well knew, were attempting to
explain to Clarino&mdash;who had sat up till midnight to discover
it&mdash;the difference between the reflexive and the passive verb
forms.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Ashby led her on till they discovered Mrs. Ashby
engaged, with that air of glowing serenity, which had at the first
caught Julie&rsquo;s eyes, in her own peculiar bright activities.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby looked at her soberly. Something in the
girl&rsquo;s appearance held her thoughtful attention.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have come to see you&mdash;as you asked me to
do,&rdquo; Julie told her.</p>
<p class="par">She led the girl to a sunny sala overlooking the
tinkling fields. Julie, as she followed, was thinking that since Father
Hull had found in this woman a strength to die by, she might, in these
evil times, disclose a strength for living. She had pulled herself out
of very dark places. People who could so marvelously help themselves
must possess force for other lives.</p>
<p class="par">As they sat down, Julie exclaimed: &ldquo;You see, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>am unhappy! And I have a notion that I may be
ill. Last night I scarcely slept at all. Something in me is wrong, and
certainly everything outside of me is. Things are so black! Oh! What is
to happen to all these people who have worked, and hoped? I have worked
and hoped too, but it hasn&rsquo;t counted&mdash;nothing counts; I am
very nearly sure of that. I&rsquo;ve lost my position&mdash;though I
haven&rsquo;t told anybody that I was thrown out&mdash;because of
Nahal. It was a cut to the heart,&rdquo; she brooded.
&ldquo;Then&mdash;I am working for an odious man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And Barry,&rdquo; she went on restlessly.
&ldquo;What is to happen to him? I&rsquo;ve never seen him down before.
It frightens me. Are we all going down under some avalanche? Some of us
have no place else to go. I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s my eternal, foolish cry. I&rsquo;ve blistered my soul
praying about everything. I thought you would understand. Oh! You must,
for I have come to you for light. You are not blind, you are not
floundering; you are safe and sure. What is it that makes your life so
strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashby said, bending toward
her, &ldquo;what you prayed for.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For Barry&rsquo;s safety through the
world!&rdquo; Julie replied simply.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And for nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie started a trifle. &ldquo;Well, for a number of
things&mdash;at different times.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby reflected a moment. &ldquo;I used to pray
when our money was getting short that more would come so that we might
buy a fresh bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie gave a shiver of repugnance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We were both, weren&rsquo;t we, praying at
cross-purposes?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Julie frowned slightly. &ldquo;What I want to know is
why I am rolling always to disaster; why I can&rsquo;t call a
halt&mdash;why I can&rsquo;t see clearly?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know how hopeless I was&mdash;Dick and I,
drowning together, in this oriental maelstrom? We expected to finish in
one of the hells of the East. We knew that time was fast overtaking us.
And there would come to me, when I awoke sober in the night with the
whole universe clutching at my throat, the terror of those black
pits.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Many people tried to help us. I recall their
futile efforts wafting across our heedless lives. Then there came
across our path the Little Gray Woman, as we call her. I don&rsquo;t
know what she was doing away over here. She said she was just a joyous
old traveler of the world. She was not actually different from anyone
else, you must understand, but she found us blind things in her path
calling out from the highways for sight. It would be difficult to make
you understand just how she came to help us break the bondage of our
flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby paused thoughtfully, then went on. &ldquo;You
remember how, in divine contempt, He picked up clay and, mixing it with
spittle, laid the bandage of the earth across the eyes of those who all
their lives had understood in terms of clay&mdash;and tearing it away,
revealed to them the miracle of sight. So it came to us. We were
summoned, poor Lazaruses, from our tombs, into the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby lowered her head. &ldquo;This is a strange
language to you, and these are not revelations for a laughing world,
but for those who are going out in darkness&mdash;for men stricken in
agony on the battlefield, for all who like you are in the throes of
terror <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>and destruction. These truths are the springs
outside your reach across the thirsty desert.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When you come at last upon the light, the
grave-clothes the mind has worn so long drop away; the false garment
man has spread across the face of things dissolves, and you find that
you are not in the world for a day, but that you are in the
<i>universe</i> forever.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! If you only knew it, you could walk free
through the earth, fearing nothing. When I found that I was not thonged
by crucified feet to an inexorable world, that the world was only a
snowdrop on the face of the eternal, a mood of the universe; and that I
was greater than all of it, could shape it with my will, touch the
widest reaches with my thought&mdash;that of all creation, God and my
kind alone could <i>will</i>&mdash;then the light of Paul broke!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The light of Paul, Julie! A golden light, beating
on the soul, revealing its far country, the kingdoms of the unseen
whose invisible marvels can be brought to our own threshold.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was in the knowledge that it was not death he
was facing, but a new direction in God&rsquo;s areas, that Father Hull
passed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why did he die?&rdquo; the girl asked abruptly.
&ldquo;I felt queerly to blame for being so weak that I couldn&rsquo;t
do anything. Doctors have told me that they have had the same feeling,
even when they have exerted themselves to the utmost.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! There you are touching upon the kingdoms of
the unseen. All their powers can be brought to our threshold,&rdquo;
she repeated, &ldquo;as Franklin brought the lightning out of the blank
sky. We don&rsquo;t know half the forces that move through the
universe. Another generation will understand. We are but poor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>jugglers tossing glass balls, when we might be
moving stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But&mdash;you tried,&rdquo; the girl
stammered.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Ashby cast upon her a new look. &ldquo;You saw
that!&rdquo; She brooded in silence for some time. At last she said:
&ldquo;We are in mystery still. It will take a long time. He did not
understand, nor did I&mdash;enough. You have to be very strong for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl rose. &ldquo;Alas! I am used to things as they
seem. I see the shapes and the obstacles of the world very plainly. I
am traveling a longer road than to Damascus, and I don&rsquo;t see the
light. But I shall always remember what you have said to-day.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can only grasp at the tail of your ideas; but
that one thought&mdash;that I am not of the world, but of the
universe&mdash;that is sweet and splendid. It carries me on wings into
regions I&rsquo;ve never dreamed about. To be timeless, spaceless, to
wear a garment of the Indestructible, and to share its miracles!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was sick of the pettiness of this little earth,
and hideously afraid of the universe; afraid of its sinister
unexpectedness, its soullessness towards the microcosm Me, and its
imminent threat to break me so that I never could be put together
again. You have made it all seem different&mdash;and wonderful. Just as
if I had found that there were fairies again in the world, and that I
was one of them, instead of a trampled little atom not worth bothering
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie went away shining in the new mood; but as she
moved back into the material, exotic world, she felt her glorious
immunity wearing away, and herself forced to battle to keep her
conviction against the old calamitous universe with its desperately
insoluble problems. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On her way home Julie happened to pass her former
school. The old crone to whom she still came for medicine was standing
outside the stall. The girl stopped to speak to her.</p>
<p class="par">The old creature passed her brown bones of fingers over
her uncanny face and, staring into the face of the sun, began to mutter
strangely again about the search for the Ark. A fantastic being, the
girl thought, trudging over the earth after a chimera.</p>
<p class="par">Julie told her that the medicine drove the pain away,
but that, because of the heat, perhaps, she could not eat or sleep
well, and that there came to her the strangest dreams in the world. In
them the earth became transparent&mdash;she could see clearly through
it. She could see people grow, bit by bit, under her eyes; and the
forest, by some deep instinct, knew her, and the flowers laughed and
cried like children.</p>
<p class="par">The old woman said that all this was true; that in the
old days when she lived in the splendors of the world the jungle used
to be very hostile to her and would tear at her with its teeth and
sprinkle her with its poisons and set its reptiles against her; but now
that she had made friends with it she could go through the heart of it
and never be hurt. She described how she plucked her herbs, male and
female in equal proportion, out of jungles where no man&rsquo;s foot
had touched, when the benign forces of the air preponderated over the
malign.</p>
<p class="par">Julie said that the body was a stupid abiding place
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>after these dreams, which put upon her soul
marvelous new moods, like a moon forever at the full.</p>
<p class="par">The old woman clutched at the wheel of the <i lang=
"es">carromata</i> and stared at her with unfathomable eyes. &ldquo;Why
did you not come with me when I asked you?&rdquo; she entreated.
&ldquo;You and I could have freed ourselves from the wickedness of the
earth, which is a heavy black bundle tied to the back of mortals. We
would have searched for the lost Covenant between God and
Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For an instant a weird vision rose before the girl of
the places those footsteps would lead to, down dirty by-ways of the
East, catching one&rsquo;s food where one could, brushing skirts with
lepers and thieves, in hazes of furnace heat. Thank heaven, not all the
incarnations of the East could bring her to a thing like that! And yet
for an instant the preposterous invitation had sent an odd thrill
through her. This nondescript old woman had touched her soul.</p>
<p class="par">She smiled sadly, and shook her head, and the witch,
dropping back from the wheel, moved away, muttering,
&ldquo;Adios!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And that was the last of her that Julie ever saw.</p>
<p class="par">A few days later, she returned this way from the
Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s, to obtain a fresh supply of medicine. Only one
pellet lay in the box at home. But from the shack opposite the school,
the old woman had disappeared, without leaving a sign behind her.
Because of the manner of her going, the Stall-keeper was positive that
she would never come back.</p>
<p class="par">In frightened dismay, Julie inquired of Mariana and
Clarino, both of whom had secretly bought amulets of the old
woman&mdash;Mariana, to enable herself to withstand the attraction of
an unusually eligible lover; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>Clarino, to become the
principal of a school, to which honor he fearfully aspired. But neither
knew anything about her: she was a wandering witch, no doubt, who had
perhaps gone away on a broomstick into the sky.</p>
<p class="par">It was through Delphine she received the only light she
ever had on the old woman&rsquo;s going. Disturbed over her
disappearance from school, Delphine had sought her out at her quarters.
She explained to him that she had been ill, and mentioned that she had
not been able to procure any more of a medicine which had brought her
great relief, and which she had been in the habit of buying from an old
charm-woman near the school, who had mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dicky-Dicky sent her away!&rdquo; Delphine
exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;I saw him come out suddenly upon her, a few
squares from the school, and tell her over and over to go
away&mdash;that danger threatened several people if she were seen
around any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">What did the dwarf mean? Delphine did not know, he did
not ask Dicky-Dicky questions because he got severely slapped on the
head for such efforts.</p>
<p class="par">Gone, taking her secret off with her! That was the way
with these people&mdash;always under your feet, until some day, at some
mysterious signal, they took themselves finally off! Julie thought with
terror of all that lay ahead of her, to face unrelieved&mdash;the
relentless hot season, her perilous hold on a disorganizing community,
her bad health. With the aid of the medicine, she had managed to endure
and to go unsteadily on, but the thought of trying to continue without
it caused her limbs to grow cold. There was not fire nor force enough
in her to fight the rest of the way. To her other trials it was
impossible to add ceaseless and grilling <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>pain. In a few weeks
she might have to go out of this country&mdash;and the passage money
was nowhere in sight. Something might yet happen to turn her fate.
Until then she must find a way to get the medicine.</p>
<p class="par">Old Kantz, the chemist on Calle Alean, had been in the
East for forty years. He would be bound to know what the medicine was
and to be able perhaps to get more of it. Julie preferred him to
Se&ntilde;or Reredo whose shop was not far distant. So when
Se&ntilde;or Sansillo went to Los Ba&ntilde;os on business she seized
the half holiday to go and see Kantz.</p>
<p class="par">As she entered the Botica a native clerk slumbrously
uprose behind the counter. It was a hot day. Nobody was about in it but
tired, driven Americans who take account of neither day nor night.
Julie made clear to him, however, that she must see Kantz at once.</p>
<p class="par">The old chemist was finishing his siesta upstairs, but
as he was accustomed to act as an emergency doctor to his neighborhood
he came down, clad in white trousers and an undershirt that covered his
fat person like his skin. This attire was not really unconventional in
a land where attire might follow almost any persuasion of the mind.</p>
<p class="par">He adjusted his huge lenses and nodded professionally to
the girl. Julie, wondering at her own precipitancy and unable to set
forth any explanation of it to Kantz, began in an uncertain voice.
&ldquo;I have a medicine here&mdash;that I have been taking for some
time&mdash;for very bad head-aches. I can&rsquo;t get any more of it
and I want to see if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo; He poked the pellet with
a fat finger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she stammered
uneasily. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>seemed so foolish a reply to make in the face of
this array of bottles confronting her like so many incontrovertible
facts and to Kantz who looked like the biggest bottle and the most
absolute fact of all.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Unable to escape, Julie replied in a lowered voice,
&ldquo;It was given me by&mdash;a&mdash;a herb woman who had helped
people I know&mdash;of. She has gone away. I can&rsquo;t find her. I
need the medicine&rdquo;&mdash;with rising spirit and an attempt at
dignity&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a native specific.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait, I will try and analyze it.&rdquo; He turned
into his tiny laboratory, the pellet, the last one, stuck perilously on
his moist thumb.</p>
<p class="par">Julie sat down and studied respectfully the irrefutable
bottles. The clerk mixed himself a surreptitious drink behind the
counter, and fell into gentle extinction.</p>
<p class="par">Finally Kantz&rsquo;s great shape moved in, and Julie,
glancing up, found him looking at her very hard&mdash;stare which even
before he opened his mouth, threw every cell in her into turmoil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ach! I have lived in the East for forty years,
and do you think I do not know all the tricks of your kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl tried to be sure that she was not confronting a
maniac&mdash;but he was so monstrously calm. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo; she quavered in fright.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That you will not get any more of that medicine,
here or in any other drug store unless the keeper wishes to go to
Bilibid.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4423src" href="#xd21e4423"
name="xd21e4423src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">He employed a threatening, familiar tone. Once she had
heard a man speak to a drunkard like that. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is the stuff?&rdquo; she cried wildly.
&ldquo;Is it poison? Tell me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He turned to his bottles. &ldquo;These dope
fiends!&rdquo; he muttered exasperated, to them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dope fiends!&rdquo; the girl repeated stupidly.
&ldquo;A drug! Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; she cried agonizedly,
&ldquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since the new laws, you will find opium
impossible to get. So I tell them all&mdash;and they go
crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared with wildly dilated eyes, her bloodless
lips parted as if to protest. Then she fell against the counter. There
was a dead hush in the deserted place. Not even a fly buzzed through
the scorching silence. Julie tried to lift her paralyzed arms to ward
something off. She was dreaming. She had taken too much medicine.
Things like this didn&rsquo;t happen!</p>
<p class="par">But there, blistering her, was the chemist&rsquo;s
cynical gaze. Day by day she had been moving towards this wall&mdash;a
blind dupe. She had had a sunstroke on Adams&rsquo;s grave, and an old
woman had offered her some medicine for it, and out of this simple
sequence destruction had appeared. The avalanche of final ruin swept
over the girl&rsquo;s fevered mind. She had been dragged
down&mdash;clear down. The slow but inevitable juggernaut of the East
had pulled her under at last, &ldquo;grist for the mill&mdash;you and
I,&rdquo; Adams had said long ago. Out of a clear sky had fallen this
final, cruel joke.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; The piteous question
seemed, to fall on rather than be directed to the chemist.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why then did you begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She repeated her story lamely, disjointedly and in
tears, conscious of its futility&mdash;Kantz was so fatally
incredulous. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After a time,&rdquo; he told the bottles,
&ldquo;they cannot tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl looked at him with terrible despair.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You do not believe me&mdash;nobody will believe
me. Oh!&rdquo; she caught at her throat and stared at him with the eyes
of a caged animal. She clutched at his arms in frantic pleading.
&ldquo;You are as good as a doctor. Give me something that will cure
me. I would offer you a lot of money, but I haven&rsquo;t any. I
<i>will</i> not go on always wanting that horrible stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a long hunger. Sometimes it lasts as long
as life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to get into it&mdash;that
must count. Help me! I am afraid. You must believe me&mdash;I am not a
liar! There is a cure for everything&mdash;everything,&rdquo; she cried
wildly. &ldquo;Mrs. Ashby said so&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her head dropped on the counter and she wept
uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="par">The chemist stared down at her uncomfortably.
&ldquo;Just stop!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no other
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie lifted herself up with a dizzy lurch and plunged
out of the botica. A strange being in her form walked the streets,
which had become a phantasmagoria of horror. Black shapes of doom
seemed haunting the avenues of life&mdash;she, the blackest shape of
all, groping through under-hells for light. She belonged now to the
East forever and forever. It had set its stamp of hopelessness upon
her. She moved along staring with desperation and repugnance at this
dark race with whose fate she had become allied.</p>
<p class="par">She walked without direction, on and on, not knowing
where she was going, goaded by an immeasurable despair. She wandered
half way across the city, hatless, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>the sun scorching her head;
what goal could there ever be again? All their lives even the few cured
struggled, Kantz had said. A cursed pilgrimage the world, to these
Wandering Jews of souls! And she wasn&rsquo;t made for struggle. For a
fearful fight like this in which she had only one small, slim
chance&mdash;she knew in her soul she had not the force. She might
struggle a little while, but it was not in her being to combat to the
end. It was easier to die&mdash;but one didn&rsquo;t die, that was the
worst.</p>
<p class="par">She stood still on a street corner staring blankly about
her. There was no use in going on. There was nothing ahead ever,
however far she went. She stood there dully and thought of one thing,
the flaky thing that had hung to Kantz&rsquo;s careless finger. Only
<i>that</i> would lift a little while this madness of sun, and pain and
strangling despair. As she gazed tormentedly about her, her mind
suddenly made clear the significance of her surroundings. All this
wandering had been a subconscious hunt upon which some dim urgent sense
had been leading her&mdash;to the one spot where there was a chance of
getting what she desired. Chinamen always had it.</p>
<p class="par">The girl paused horror-struck. But against the visions
she desperately set up, visions of her youth&rsquo;s high quest, of a
splendid new Empire of Mankind&mdash;of a Prince of the East, a
throbbing insistence that had never been denied arose and claimed every
atom of her being and wiped out every thought. Dim, distant visions
they were now. Not one of them could help&mdash;or save her. The Hunger
consumed every fiber.</p>
<p class="par">Yet the anguish, the urge of her memories assailed her
all the while&mdash;visions that had stirred her spirit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>terribly accused; voices, very dear voices
pleaded with her wretched soul.</p>
<p class="par">Once that lane had been for her the evilest channel in
which she had seen life move. Now her torment swept her onward into its
currents. She must get a little&mdash;secretly&mdash;ever so little, to
help her through the woods.</p>
<p class="par">She moved like a sleep-walker, a glazed look on her
haunted face, among the little stalls, muttering what she wanted under
her breath. Nobody must see her on such an errand in such an
unspeakable place. The yellow half-shaven heads leered at her like
grinning skulls, and pretended not to know what she wanted. They were
uncannily wily, exercising their super-evil intuitions. The laws were
very strict. They must make sure of her.</p>
<p class="par">She feared them terribly. The old shadow, like the
hangman&rsquo;s cap, pressed down over her mind as it had done before.
She knew what a welter of evil desires her youthful body evoked up and
down the street&mdash;but she had forgotten her body, everything but
this goading of the furies.</p>
<p class="par">She pursued her way among the stalls. <i>It</i> was here
and they should not outwit her. The yellowed skulls thrust themselves
upon her, their fishy eyes intimating all the wickedness in the world.
At one shop the Chinaman appeared to understand. She had put a paper
bill upon the counter. He lifted the board that barricaded him behind
the counter, and beckoned her to follow. The rear of the shop was black
and musty. The Chinaman opened a trap door, and ducked down under the
ground. He emerged in a moment with a small package which he held out
to her. Julie started forward to get it. The creature&rsquo;s arm swung
out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>and clutched her. She screamed, but one of the
yellow paws dropped over her mouth. Her whole life seemed to go out of
her in a final wave of fright. She knew what would happen to her down
in that black cavern.</p>
<p class="par">She wrestled against him. He put his hand upon her
throat. She could feel to her spine the chill of those yellow fingers
compressing her throbbing breath. As she fought away from him, the jade
medallion jerked out of her dress. She could feel it on her bosom
dancing about wildly. The hold on her throat relaxed. The creature had
caught at the amulet with one hand. The girl took wild advantage of his
distraction to wrench herself out of his grasp. Diving under the
counter she hurled herself into the open street. Nobody was following
her, but she fled, with a sobbing cry, through the dust down the center
of the street, the denizens of the stalls thrusting out their heads
like cobras to stare after her.</p>
<p class="par">She continued to run even after she had gotten into safe
districts, on and on like a mad thing. Natives stopped to stare at the
white woman run amuck. In her tumult of brain she saw but one vision.
Down under the floor of this city, where its black beating heart lay
filled with the monstrous passions of men, where a motley evil crew
from all the coasts of the East trafficked in human life and flesh,
down there she was fated to sink. She had seen her end written on every
one of those opium-devastated skulls. Even now she would have been
hurled to a rung below hell if the Chinese charm had not diverted her
assailant. She had not been saved by her own will nor yet even by an
oriental fetish, but by the emblem of one man&rsquo;s love. She
remembered the things she had swept aside to go into that horrible
street. Nothing had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>weighed in the madness of the
moment&mdash;a moment of hideous impulse that had twisted in
devastation every fiber of her being and left it a wrecked thing whose
roots a tornado had splintered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They that go down to dust!&rdquo; ran in her
fevered brain.</p>
<p class="par">She hurried along, her body shivering, though it was a
hot day. Suddenly she saw she was nearing her objective, and stopped to
run her feverish, trembling fingers through her pale hair. As she stood
in front of Se&ntilde;or Reredo&rsquo;s drug store her heart beat so
loudly she feared that he might suspect what was in it.</p>
<p class="par">The Botica, after the native fashion, was broadly open.
No barrier must interpose between the native and his passion for the
street. The Se&ntilde;or, his slim legs, terminated by red slippered
feet, curled around the rungs of a high chair, was reading <i lang=
"es">El Progresso</i>, a native organ. He rose when he saw Julie and
asked how he could serve her.</p>
<p class="par">She wanted some more of that lotion for tan that he had
put up for her. It was more efficacious than anything else she had ever
used. She complimented him upon his ability as a chemist; if he should
go into business in Spain that ability would be recognized. The
Se&ntilde;or, gratified, admitted that here among the
&ldquo;Indianos&rdquo; was no sphere for a man&rsquo;s brains. They
expanded into a discussion of different panaceas. Julie suddenly put
her package down on the counter and soberly regarded him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, my friend Barry says that an
epidemic of cholera is breaking out in this city. He says it is
spreading like wildfire and that it will be the worst plague, perhaps,
that the Islands have known.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The plague we have with us always,&rdquo; the
Se&ntilde;or replied. &ldquo;The Americans take it too
seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It rages in the provinces and it has come heavily
to many districts here. Barry is greatly worried. He warned me
vehemently&mdash;and I am afraid. The water, the food, every mouthful,
every swallow means danger. More than anything conceivable I fear the
Peste. One suffers horribly and cannot die at once. If one could carry
always with one something to bring death quickly! I had a friend once
who traveled much on railroads where one is in danger of terrible
accidents. Once he was buried under the wreckage of a coach and there
came an awful time to him, when he feared they would not get him out.
After that he carried tied around his neck always a little
sack&mdash;three grains of morphine&mdash;and he was insured. If you
would give me the means&mdash;to go&mdash;quickly in case I were
hopelessly stricken, I would not fear any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Se&ntilde;or stared disquietedly at the counter.
&ldquo;Perhaps, I should have left sooner, I have many
children!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A teacher who came over on the boat with me has
just died of it!&rdquo; Julie shivered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will tell Sofia!&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;that it is just as well to go at once. Se&ntilde;or Barry
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I must stay, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; the girl
pleaded, &ldquo;in this terror I have no place to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He meditated. &ldquo;Well, if it makes you feel
safe!&rdquo; He turned to his drawers. &ldquo;Three grains! Yes,&rdquo;
he reflected, &ldquo;that should be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl picked up the little box nervously.
&ldquo;Thank you, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she said. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Julie walked back into her room, and stared
heavily about this shell of her old existence where day by day the rope
had been tightening inexorably around her throat. The room looked like
a place she had never seen.</p>
<p class="par">On the bed, suggesting her own spent mortal frame
stretched helplessly prostrate, lay a worn evening gown. It brought the
room back to familiar proportions. The recollection swept over her that
to-night Isabel was going to have a party, and that she had put the
dress there this morning&mdash;a time which seemed now to have no
connection with her existence&mdash;to determine whether it could be
made to hold together for this one night. Isabel had sent her a note,
begging her to forget their last meeting and to come to the party.
Nothing, of course, could change that explosion of hatred. Yet this
morning she had decided to go.</p>
<p class="par">She stared out at her Asian garden. She seemed to see a
quick-stepping figure moving down there among the sighing trees. She
turned away wretchedly. That was over forever. Soon, when the Reredos
went away, the forsaken garden would revert to the jungle. Nobody would
remember it. Yes, her soul would find a way to come to this spot of
beauty, where the most splendid visions of her life had been
evoked.</p>
<p class="par">She began to gather up her belongings. They made just
one trunkful,&mdash;everything that, after nearly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>twenty-one years of sojourn on the planet, she
owned. She wondered if there were not something very wrong with a
person who could not accumulate more than that after such a long time.
The Se&ntilde;or had advanced her a week&rsquo;s salary, which must be
returned. She counted the money out of her purse, and laid it on the
table. Then she fumbled in her trunk for her letters. The first one she
came upon was the notification of dismissal from the Department. The
next, Adams&rsquo;s letter, still crying forth its bitter
loneliness.</p>
<p class="par">Then she sat down and wrote a letter to her uncle; and
here at last her dulled heart was able to bleed. She had tried very,
very hard, she told him. She was terribly sorry that things had turned
out as they had. But the East was like the Bank of Monte
Carlo&mdash;with the odds always against you. Of that final catastrophe
that had come to wipe out her last chance, she found it impossible to
speak. To his Western consciousness away off there, on the other side
of the world, in a secure and ordered scheme of life, such monstrous
happenings would be inconceivable. A pitiful, incoherent document, that
accounted for nothing really, splashed all over with Julie&rsquo;s
tears.</p>
<p class="par">She aroused herself feverishly, and examined the dress.
The anger of that last meeting with Isabel stood out forcibly before
her mind. Isabel hated her because of Barry. And Isabel did not hate
fruitlessly. All her emotions found vital expression.</p>
<p class="par">Something kept welling up from the depths of the
girl&rsquo;s sub-consciousness&mdash;something that was like a wavering
clew. Quite without reason, a face rose before her vision&mdash;a face
looking up stealthily above Isabel&rsquo;s staircase. It turned, and
revealed&mdash;the face of the old medicine crone! Not till this moment
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>memory welded these two associations. The old
crone had some identification with Isabel. In her bent shadowy shape,
Isabel&rsquo;s hatred took form. Isabel had wanted terribly to get her
out of the way. She had not dared to kill her, but she had selected a
method of elimination too subtle for its agency to be traced. And
Dicky-Dicky, the Dwarf, who had had a place in his heart that was
called Nahal, had known, and because of it had frightened the Old Woman
away, and attempted to save her&mdash;too late. Yes, it was clear
enough now.</p>
<p class="par">Chad and Rosalie had been her accomplices, no doubt. But
though Chad had been hostile, he had been openly so. Julie was
reluctant to accuse him of any complicity in so Oriental a plot as that
Isabel had woven. But against the whole white race, Rosalie would have
lent herself as an instrument of destruction. Julie could see how
Isabel would work upon the fury of her jealousy, set up before it
everything American that Rosalie might believe was responsible for the
abstraction of her husband&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p class="par">Soon, they had planned, she would be nothing at all but
a bundle of flesh, with an appetite&mdash;a thing that no human
passions could ever reclaim. And when she was wiped out&mdash;the shame
and horror of her&mdash;Barry would be elevated to the place that
Isabel was preparing for him. Julie remembered the talk of a paradise.
She began to cry again.</p>
<p class="par">She had not seen Barry&mdash;for an eternity! She must
see him&mdash;if only to attempt to make clear to him the things that
were in her soul. In the urgency of this desire, everything else was
swallowed up. After all there was nothing more that Isabel could do to
her. She would go to the party. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309"
href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">While dressing, she studied herself in the glass. An
image rose before her&mdash;the image of herself that had confronted
her on that distant, transported day on the other side of the world,
the day she had stepped into life and had offered herself with such
magnificence to its designs. Who was to blame? If the Nahalites had had
the grace of God&mdash;if Isabel&mdash;the East&mdash;had not hunted
her down!</p>
<p class="par">As she was about to leave the room, she turned back, and
laid on the table an envelope with some money in it, addressed to
Se&ntilde;ora Reredo. She picked up her uncle&rsquo;s letter to mail,
and the money for Se&ntilde;or Sansillo, glanced agitatedly around the
room for an instant, and hurried out of the house.</p>
<p class="par">Se&ntilde;or Sansillo was upstairs when she reached his
house, but he came down immediately when he heard who it was that
wished to see him. Julie, pale and tense, stood waiting for him in the
doorway of his office.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to tell you that I shall not be
here any more!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">He gave a start. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; the girl flung out, &ldquo;I am
weary of earning my living listening to questionable stories, and
having horrible jewelry thrust on me. Here is the money you advanced.
Thank you!&rdquo; She held a roll of bills out to him.</p>
<p class="par">An angry flush swept over his face. &ldquo;You are
suddenly independent, Se&ntilde;orita Dreschell?&rdquo; he satirically
exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, my independence came suddenly to me!&rdquo;
she agreed, &ldquo;therefore I shall never come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He darkened volcanically. &ldquo;You must not&mdash;do
that!&rdquo; he commanded, in a shaken voice. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">He did not attempt to speak again for a moment, but
broodingly studied her face as if to find the key to his new behavior.
He must have come to realize the unalterable nature of this new
purpose, for he said in tones so strangely humble the girl could
scarcely recognize them as utterance of his: &ldquo;If I promise that I
will do these things no more, will you stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She shook her head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I beg of you to remain!&rdquo; he insisted in a
low voice. &ldquo;I will ask only that you sit at that window where you
have always sat&mdash;only that, no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She was startled to perceive that tears of emotion had
gathered in his eyes. Suddenly he burst into a torrent of speech, as he
paced agitatedly to and fro.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think then that I have had so much in
life?&rdquo; he demanded turning round fiercely upon her. &ldquo;Know
then that I have been thwarted in all that I ever desired! Fifteen
years ago I came to these colonies, penniless, alone. My family had
lost everything in Spain. Like many another Spanish youth, I set out
with hopes that towered to the skies, for I was young and full of hope.
El Dorado would bring me my fortune, I believed, just as you believed
it would bring you yours.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I found myself a stranger without
affiliations in a strange land. My illustrious name counted for nothing
in such a country. I was a lawyer, but there were plenty more of my
kind who were woven into the network of the Blood, you understand.
Shall I tell you how I starved in this land, how my heart ached to
breaking because of it! One way of salvation opened to me, the way of
most of my desperate countrymen. It was a dark way to me, but it opened
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>closed gates of the East. I, too, entered this
freemasonry of blood. It was smooth traveling after that,
but&rdquo;&mdash;he tore ferociously at his immaculate
waistcoat&mdash;&ldquo;if the years could be swung back, and I could
walk these streets destitute&mdash;but free and a youth
again&mdash;yes, for that. I would toss Satan my soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He put his hand up to his throat. &ldquo;You came! I
used to dream of one like you on that old ship, I, a poor lad on the
way to the East to find my fortune: I have tried everything with you, I
admit. I was a devil, as you say&mdash;but am I not bound in a web
whose threads are as strong as the tentacles of the devil fish? This
place will turn black as hell after you are gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He paused with hands appealingly outstretched. Another
darkened soul! A feeling of pity swept over the girl. She turned upon
him a commiserative face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am sorry for you. I am sorry for all of us who
sought fortune in the East. We are a pitiable lot, Se&ntilde;or. Drive
around the Escolta any night, and you will see us in our several
unhappy stages of decay. Some of us were not big enough for our task.
Oh, I, too, would have given anything to have succeeded!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what is to become of you?&rdquo; he cried, in
genuine solicitude. &ldquo;You are ill. You have no money and without
money one cannot live one instant in this terrible land. Reverse your
mad decision, and stay here. You shall have nothing to fear from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie shook her head speechlessly. She and her concerns
had sunk into a whirlpool of despair, but there remained the one
passionate satisfaction of being able to sweep her soul clean at last.
So much, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>much money that she had not earned&mdash;the
thought of it burned like fire. She put out her hand. &ldquo;Good-by,
Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Isabel&rsquo;s house twinkled from a distance with fiery
lights. The strains of the orchestra playing, like a band, loud chords
of revel, tore open the peace of the night. Julie ascended into an
atmosphere in which the note of triumph seemed everywhere proclaimed.
Isabel had decorated the place amazingly with palms and tropical
flowers. Dark faces flowed about in currents of festivity, wearing,
Julie thought, an appalling aspect of victory. Isabel conveyed this
impression pre&euml;minently. She appeared to be in the throes of some
delirious celebration of soul. It was as if there blazed forth from her
personality the triumph of many cities and multitudes of islands made
glad. She terrified Julie.</p>
<p class="par">All this exultation fell like the weight of doom on the
girl&rsquo;s aching spirit. She herself seemed to represent the living
defeat of her countrymen. Few of them were here to-night. Their absence
made a haunting void in the throng. The charge had gone out of them,
the force: almost as if something had taken God out of the universe,
and left it to stumble on by itself. Her weary mind dwelt with a great
effort for an instant on the tangled threads of their disappointments.
America wished to withdraw from her position in the East; from all the
potentialities of her presence there. The Eastern problem was not, she
held, her responsibility. Perhaps the corner of it she had lifted
appalled her. Perhaps she had attempted a too ambitious job. No group
of men&mdash;not even the dauntless ones who had grappled with the
tremendous difficulties here&mdash;could make over the East in a few
short experimental <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313"
name="pb313">313</a>]</span>years. At any rate, after successive
agitations, the country, divided on the question of colonial
possessions, seemed now to have come to the point of relinquishment;
and the unclosed scaffoldings of the attempted structure of enlightened
government in the East would be left to rot before the gaze of the
Orient. Julie knew that that was what her countrymen hated&mdash;not
the going, but the failure left behind, the judgment pronounced upon
them in the courts of the world.</p>
<p class="par">Julie was watching with every nerve for Barry. Once more
to have the old fire thrown over her. But after all this fearful
waiting, what would there be to say? Even if she poured forth the tale
of her wholly wretched situation, there was nothing ever, ever, that he
could do. If she had been before unfit for him, she was now utterly
removed from him. Certainly he could not move through life with such a
thing as it was fated she should become dragging around his neck. They
had been too near to each other for her to inflict upon him a brutality
like that. Fright at this picture of ruin for them both turned her
faint. Perhaps after all, she had better not wait.</p>
<p class="par">Chad passed, his face pale and abstracted. He nodded at
the spot where Julie stood rooted. She gazed after him with a piteous
absence of ill-will. His had been such a tiny contributory force to the
avalanche. She forced herself to move on towards Isabel, who
intolerably radiant and shining, wavered across her path. Isabel came
down abruptly out of her glorified mood, and searched the girl&rsquo;s
broken and disintegrated being with a passionately curious gaze.</p>
<p class="par">Julie knew that Isabel was waiting for the signal of
complete capitulation, and she struggled with all her force to withhold
the surrendering sign. As she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>looked on the triumph and
terror of this woman, one of the dark lusts of this land that had
surged all about her heretofore without touching her, suddenly took
possession of her. She wanted to strike Isabel, to beat her out of
existence. She had borne enough in this black land, and this woman was
not only her enemy, but her destroyer&mdash;the very symbol of the
country which had twisted and thwarted and wholly wrecked her life. She
stumbled toward Isabel, whose purple eyes must have fathomed some mad
intent, for she stepped warily back till the crowd interposed between
them. Julie&rsquo;s impulse failed&mdash;a poor avenging instrument
she. As she wheeled away, she saw Isabel&rsquo;s countenance assume an
expression as if some godly satisfaction had been handed down to
her.</p>
<p class="par">Her desperate eyes still searching in every direction,
Julie rambled unsteadily on. Everything looked strange, as if she had
never belonged to the pageant of human passions. Oh! To be back again
in the rich moving of human passions!</p>
<p class="par">She came upon a group talking in hushed tones. The
ejaculations of dismay sounded an odd note in this hard festal blare.
Major Holborne was knitting his brows; Chad&rsquo;s face wore a queer
arrested look; a woman uttered a soft cry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When did you hear it?&rdquo; somebody asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This evening, while people were on the Luneta.
The police telephoned me to get her husband. He wouldn&rsquo;t
go&mdash;so I went,&rdquo; Holborne said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Julie demanded.</p>
<p class="par">Nobody replied at once, then Chad said heavily:
&ldquo;Leah Chamberlain threw herself out of a window of the
Oriente&mdash;and dashed out her brains.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The girl was still for a moment.
&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p class="par">The men said nothing. Mrs. Burke, a little English woman
drew her aside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never safe to ask why. Locroft was
called home, he had come into the title; and&mdash;well, I suppose it
was all impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Another impasse! Leah, the
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp&mdash;who, every one had said, had never had a
serious feeling in her gossamer existence&mdash;displaying at last a
supreme, deadly seriousness. It was inevitable that one who had so
completely held her life in her own hands should herself have destroyed
that life. Leah would never consent to live or die except on her own
terms.</p>
<p class="par">Julie glanced up from where she stood frozenly
considering Leah&rsquo;s fate, to behold Barry coming in her direction.
His invincibly lifted head quickened her. Every human thing about him
sent a thrill through her deadened senses&mdash;the desert face full of
visions, the ardor of life that was in him. For an instant it seemed as
though she were being brought back into sanity and safety again, as if
through his presence a loop-hole of escape must open up.</p>
<p class="par">But immediately following these sensations there rose
before her brain a vision of a horrible street with bleached faces
thrust up out of the bowels of the earth. Her fingers clutched the spot
where the stolen medallion had hung, the token of his spirit that had
intervened between her and a monstrous fate. The chain remained intact;
she thrust it down in her dress so that he might not notice that the
medallion was gone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Julie!&rdquo; he exclaimed coming quickly towards
her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She replied with an articulate sound of joy and
terror.</p>
<p class="par">He took both her hands in the joy of meeting and drew
her out of observation to the gallery.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sick for a sight of you&mdash;in
a desert abandoned, choked with sand!&rdquo; The tone of his voice
brought the tears smarting to her eyes. &ldquo;I used to have a
thousand things in my life&mdash;a million&mdash;and now all I&rsquo;ve
been thinking about is you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The blood came back into her face and life into her
heart.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do I care for the world without you in it? I
wouldn&rsquo;t walk the sick old place without you.&rdquo; His voice
broke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still following some disastrous mirage! Ah,
Julie&mdash;when our souls have the same dreams in them&mdash;and have
beckoned each other across the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He put his arms about her, and kissed her. She burst
into agonized tears and clung to him. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that the miracle!&rdquo; he cried in radiant
tenderness. &ldquo;In this moment we&rsquo;ve become endowed with a
hundred lives! Henceforth we&rsquo;ll take the rough paths together.
China, Julie, old China&mdash;the wonder of it. You and I and Sun Yat
Sen, up and down the plains and highways, touching the gophers into
fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The gophers!&rdquo; she shuddered away.
&ldquo;Oh! How can you bear to stay in this brutal place? It hates so
bitterly. It takes revenge so monstrously! It has eaten up our dreams,
torn our hopes from us, and rolled our lives in the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the wonder of it, Julie,&rdquo; he argued,
with glowing eyes. &ldquo;The mystery of it, and the unending struggle
beating about you like wings of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>invisible! The battle
of light and darkness&mdash;God&rsquo;s own dear battle. The human
strain at its utmost, the heights and the depths! Why, I&rsquo;d be in
it forever. I&rsquo;d not miss it for anything. I would keep on
tramping in it with a sack at my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s teeth bit at her white lips. &ldquo;And
the terror of it,&rdquo; she cried fiercely; &ldquo;the cruelty, the
evil of it; the plagues that are even now eating up the city of your
hopes&mdash;Oh, the death that waits in all its paths!&rdquo; She
leaned back weakly against a post.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard path truly,&rdquo; he conceded.
&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve starved in the East, and come
close to its bottomless pools. It is only a short while since, that I
thought I was on the high places for good, with the universe at my
back; but I&rsquo;m down on foot again in the dusty road, along with
the rest of the world. But I never think of those times&mdash;for what
cocoon remembers his worm&rsquo;s body? We are going
on&mdash;to-morrow, or next day. You haven&rsquo;t seen China.
We&rsquo;re refugees, but she&rsquo;ll find us our place. Nobody that
has ever won a foot of the world turned back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her white face stared mutely at him for a moment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up to your&mdash;golden journeys,
Barry,&rdquo; she said painfully, her lips quivering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
have to be made all over again for that! You must go alone&mdash;or
with some one that can help you. But&mdash;perhaps you won&rsquo;t
forget me, even if I was such a futile thing. When the sun sinks on
your deserts, call me up out of the mirage, and we&rsquo;ll plan
together&mdash;as we used to, the overthrow of the old order of
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow the road together!&rdquo; he
insisted vigorously, &ldquo;and sometime, a long while hence on the
journey, I&rsquo;ll wake you one morning with the shout that the
Millennium has come; and you will come out, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>trailing yourself in morning-glories, to welcome
the world at your gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He drew back aghast at the look in her face.</p>
<p class="par">Somebody back of them spoke Barry&rsquo;s name
inquiringly, as if not sure, in the dim light, that it was he. They
turned around, and Isabel came toward them, amazingly changed.</p>
<p class="par">She had discarded her splendid raiment, and appeared in
a short, diaphanous garment that flared about her like bloody flames.
Her black hair swept like a wind-blown scarf to her firm white
heels.</p>
<p class="par">Julie slipped suddenly back into the shadows, while
Barry stared at Isabel in strange silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dance!&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;You have often asked to see me, so come. Ah; to-night I am mad
for wings! I have something afterwards to tell you&mdash;something of
great importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She plucked Barry by the sleeve and drew him on. Barry
put out his hand to draw Julie along with him; but Isabel soon
contrived in the crowd, to separate from him the indeterminedly
following girl.</p>
<p class="par">One end of the sala had been thrown into a softly
radiant dusk. Under the streamers of one high lamp, Isabel stood and
stretched out her arms like radii of light. Then in a whirl like a sun
tumbling through the sky, she was in motion. Julie who had wandered up
to the wide crowded circle of onlookers stood feverishly watching.
Every movement of that mad, exultant whirl of limbs was an intolerable
stab. Those feet twinkling like pearls out of the wind of motion looked
as though they might kick down the stars. Julie herself had been one of
the obstacles they had kicked out of their path. Yet she could not take
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>eyes away from this dusky sorceress spinning in
fire this houri of terrible loves and hates.</p>
<p class="par">An emotional stir vibrated through the crowd. Eyes
exchanged messages. Julie looked around to find that a young Spaniard
had pressed in next to her and was regarding her with all the ardor of
his eyes. Through the wide open galleries the moonlit vision of an
intoxicating night appeared, and subtle vows seemed to whisper all down
the reaches of the tropical dusk. The young man&rsquo;s glance seemed
to say, &ldquo;Let us go&mdash;and follow the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When the palpitating circle broke, Julie crept away in
search of a small stair-case, which she remembered to have seen when
she had stopped with Isabel. It was quite impossible for her to escape
unseen by the main stair-case.</p>
<p class="par">She came out upon a small gallery somewhere at the
remote end of the house. There were others upon this gallery. Their
figures, very near her, were clearly outlined in the silver tones of
the moonlight.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared hard, then quickly dropped back into the
shadow. She waited stiller than the night itself, for she knew she had
stepped into a critical moment of a life so deeply allied to her own
that her being palpitated to every developing turn of it.</p>
<p class="par">Long before Barry could have done so, Julie divined what
was to happen.</p>
<p class="par">The two were standing looking beyond the garden, that
seemed to sing in its creation, to the spires of the city frosted under
the rising moon. Isabel was pointing to it: &ldquo;How can you bear to
give it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie, watching, saw the spasm that contracted
Barry&rsquo;s tired features. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320"
href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how, exactly, we can help
ourselves!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am not a State, you see,
I&rsquo;m only an individual, very small after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And thus ends the grand scheme to democratize the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It looks that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My poor friend,&rdquo; Isabel commiserated,
&ldquo;who tried to put a rope of sand around eternity! But no dreams
are lost&mdash;some time inevitably they take form. Dreams are the
souls of things that are about to happen. If only we could make these
particular ambitions take real shape, you and I!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Orcullu and I have worked hard, and we are about
to win. Arturo, his brother in Washington, says it is sure. You can see
that it will be so. It is a dizzy moment that is coming our way; we
have found rapacious Eastern enemies not far off, where we expected to
find friends. We must not be swallowed up, just as we become free. An
American protectorate of some sort is at first imperative; we have the
wisdom to comprehend that&mdash;and, at the helm, an
American&mdash;with the power of that nation back of
him&mdash;President of the first modern republic in Asia.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are to be the Captain of that coming
republic&mdash;the greatest honor the East ever conferred upon a white
man. We have decided it&mdash;Orcullu and I&mdash;when the hour
strikes. Our neighbor Japan will not dare touch us then. You can go on,
and do what you please. Ah, did you think I would desert you?&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you not give this land the bottomless
devotion of your heart? Well, then, the land will reward you, as it
knows how to reward all those who truly serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie fell back abruptly. Though in a measure she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>had dimly comprehended something like this, the
tremendousness, the reality of it all overwhelmed her. Barry was to see
fulfilled all that he had wanted in his soul.</p>
<p class="par">And she was wiped out utterly&mdash;so consummately had
Isabel contrived. There was something almost justifiable in the way
Isabel&mdash;and Fate&mdash;had gauged her quality, her triviality, and
had flung her aside. She had a blinding vision of herself as too weak
and purposeless to survive in this cosmos, where one&rsquo;s metal was
tested at every turn. Back there in the old world, she might have
muddled along; but here one must quickly win, or irretrievably
lose&mdash;step on or out. Ellis had dropped out, but she had tagged on
in a struggle for which she had in nowise been fitted.</p>
<p class="par">And now, though she hated Isabel impotently, hopelessly,
she saw at last, as almost an inevitable thing, her own brutal removal
from all paths whatsoever. Even if she had not already been damned, she
could not have offered Barry, ever, anything so splendid as Isabel had
achieved. She acknowledged herself completely beaten.</p>
<p class="par">She must get away&mdash;as hurriedly as possible.
Groping her way back, she found the small staircase she had started out
to seek. In the garden there was not a soul, just the stillness of
impersonal space closing cruelly around her. The whole tropical world
quivered with a passion of human futility. Pain, panic, despair, swept
her on in a current of darkness.</p>
<p class="par">The old cinder of a gate-keeper held open the gate to
let her out. Gate-keepers, she thought, were fatal people; they were
always opening disastrous portals. As she passed out, she snatched up,
with the instinct for something to cling to, a blood-red hybiscus
flower. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She stood and looked about her in hopeless uncertainty
of soul, debating which direction of the compass she should choose. A
<i lang="es">carromata</i> came drowsing along the street. The horse
came to a halt before the gate. The driver insinuated a somnolent head
in her direction, but without any real expectation in his manner.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stared hard at the thing. There was one thing
about a <i lang="es">carromata</i>&mdash;it could keep on going. She
climbed into the vehicle to the <i lang="es">cochero</i>, who wanted to
know where he should take the Se&ntilde;orita; she replied, &ldquo;Just
drive!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Familiar with the city&rsquo;s nocturnal habits, he
nodded. If this woman wished to ride in the night with her own soul, it
was her own concern. To see nothing, say nothing, and to keep
on&mdash;that was the code of the Manila Jehu.</p>
<p class="par">Horse and driver moved in slumber through the moonlight.
The city passed by all silvered, like one of God&rsquo;s cities up in
the skies. It was perfectly still, as if there were no mortals in it
any more.</p>
<p class="par">Pedro, the <i lang="es">cochero</i>, drove
semi-consciously over the endless bridges, and streets&mdash;a great
distance, clear to the moon, it seemed. He and Disgusto, his horse, in
their perpetual slow movement had gone several times round the earth to
be sure, but never had they gone so far in one journey in the dead of
the night, when the spirits were out.</p>
<p class="par">Once he had looked round to see what his fare was doing,
and had discovered her looking very hard at something she held in the
palm of her hand. The other hand, he had noticed, grasped the fading
flower. She did not see him. She saw nothing at all. Her face wore a
strange, fixed look. It was not within Pedro&rsquo;s powers to fathom
the things that concentrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>look contained. They had gone on
roaming. Once or twice into his inconsecutive dreaming a soft sound had
broken, but his subconsciousness had virtuously reminded itself of the
<i lang="es">cochero&rsquo;s</i> code, to mind one&rsquo;s, own
concerns.</p>
<p class="par">At last he sprang up out of his seat with a cry.
Something had fallen heavily against his sleeping back. Pedro was used
to almost all the startling developments of a vagabond&rsquo;s career.
He could have told strange tales of fares, but never before had one
fallen dead in his vehicle. He knew at once what had happened. For a
couple of hours, Disgusto had been carrying a dead fare over the city.
Strange journey, indeed!</p>
<p class="par">Pedro was deeply perturbed. He did not at all want the
police to get after him, but he did urgently want to see what riches
the lady had had upon her when she died. He directed Disgusto to a dark
corner of the street, fastened up the rubber rain shield of the
<i lang="es">carromata</i>, which concealed the body very well, and
also his investigating activities.</p>
<p class="par">The woman had a face like a cold star. There were
moments when, his eye falling upon it, Pedro found it hard to prosecute
his search. But she had rich raiment, and a gold ring with a fine stone
in it on the finger of the hand from which hung downwards the red
flower. Wasn&rsquo;t that like a woman, Pedro thought, to drop dead
with a flower in her hand? God had stricken her right in this vehicle.
Undoubtedly a very wicked woman, though beautiful! Too bad one
couldn&rsquo;t sell a creature as lovely as this. Such splendid beings
seldom rode in Pedro&rsquo;s cart. He passed his dark paws over the
body to see if there were anything more precious to bring to light, and
discovered the gold chain. This delighted him and whetted his appetite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>for gain. He searched the <i lang=
"es">carromata</i> absorbedly, and unearthed out of the corner of the
seat a small round box such as is used for medicine. It contained a
number of small silver coins. His fare! He emptied it greedily out into
his palm, counted the silver with devotion and slipped it into the
pocket of his frayed cotton trousers. Then he smelled speculatively the
inside of the box, turning it in every direction. His fare&rsquo;s
indefiniteness as to direction came, with a trail of suspicions, back
to his mind. In matters like this, Pedro, who had lived all his life in
the dregs of existence, had quick intuitions. This white creature had
thrown herself away; nobody at all wanted her; therefore she and all
about her were legitimate loot.</p>
<p class="par">He knew a place, providentially, not very far away,
where he might strike a good bargain. He propped the body up in the
seat and secured it there by means of ropes and a halter. It glistened
in the moonlight like an archangel, and made him afraid. He made the
ragged storm-curtain fast in front of it, and crossed himself. Never by
any chance would anybody at all know that he had a beautiful lady back
there, a dead lady who had killed herself in his <i lang=
"es">carromata</i>, and whom he was going to sell in the place without
a name where they trafficked in all things under the sun, even the
dead.</p>
<p class="par">He stopped at a spot where some old walls joined. No
opening could be perceived in the darkness, but Pedro knew this spot
better than the world which passed the walls daily but never stopped to
think what might lodge back of them. He uttered a low whistle that
pierced with a peculiar cadence the stillness of the night. Soon a
shadow and then another shadow shot out from some invisible aperture.
Pedro gestured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>to the <i lang="es">carromata</i>, flinging upon
them an ejaculation. The shadows advanced stealthily to the cart, tore
away the curtain with savage haste, flung it about the body, with which
in an instant they had disappeared behind the darkness of the walls.
Pedro, after having given Disgusto an admonitory kick, flew after them
down the narrow crooked alley made by the turns of the broken walls. On
the sandy beach not far from a crooked row of distorted dwellings the
body had been deposited, and over it, the grease of their streaming
candles falling upon it, knelt a brutal crew sweeping over it heavy,
appraising paws.</p>
<p class="par">Pedro snatched up in his hands a strand of the long,
shimmering hair, and fingered it admiringly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s through with the earth, this
one&mdash;killed herself with poison; but she must have had a fine time
in the world, in this beautiful body. There was another this evening,
at the Hotel Oriente. Zip, boom! Disgusto and I saw her come tumbling
out of the air, her brain splashing blood all over the pavement! Do
white women sin so terribly? This hair, we&rsquo;ll sell to the fair
ones of Sampolac to catch more game with. This one leave on the
sand&mdash;and when the tide comes up&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where is my price? That ring is worth much, the
chain also&mdash;and even the dress and shoes. I must have good money,
hear you, to close the mouths of the police, if anybody searches this
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The creatures, without pausing in their work of hacking
off the hair in great streamers, made a muffled retort.</p>
<p class="par">A bulk was projecting itself toward them from one of the
hideous huts. It came writhing across the sand; the ghouls, in furious
dispute now over the possession <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326"
href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>of the ring, stepped on its
groping, shuddering hands. Too weakened and blinded to move aside, it
collapsed next to the body of the girl. One of the spasmodic hands
caught and clutched in its hold the red flower that clung to her dress.
Then with a long shiver, this creature subsided in the sand.</p>
<p class="par">Pedro stared at it with eyes of horrified apprehension.
&ldquo;My money, quick!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p class="par">The outlandish group derided him. &ldquo;Get it from
him!&rdquo; they cried, pointing to the dead man.</p>
<p class="par">Without one backward glance, Pedro fled. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Dark stretches of emptiness! The rush of chaos
through endless space! Nothing anywhere that <i>knows</i>.... An
equation without a sign....</p>
<p class="par">Off in dark Eternity, a gleam of light&mdash;dividing
all space&mdash;where <i>minus</i> changes to <i>plus</i>, <i>is
not</i> to <i>is</i>. Towards it struggles, battling with all its
little strength, a mortal consciousness.</p>
<p class="par">Up out of the void, voiceless utterances sweep, like the
drone of far-off, undiscovered seas: &ldquo;Minus 5 ... 4 ... 3 ...
Minus 3 ... 2 ... 1.... Decimal point!... 9 ...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Back around an infinite circle the Soul sweeps to strike
again for being beyond the Point!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Minus&mdash;Point ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ...&rdquo;
intones the judgment from the deeps.</p>
<p class="par">Over and over, the drifting consciousness hurls itself
through the wilderness of the Lost&mdash;and over and over, the awful
voices measure throughout infinity the losing fight. Swept to the pits
of zero&mdash;Eternal Silence&mdash;the Soul, with its last desperate
knowing force, sends through the terror of the wastes its agonized
appeal: &ldquo;God, life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">That other planet had been one of light&mdash;light that
streamed over the world, and into the faces of its beings. Here, in
this ... <i>sphere</i>, black animate shadows&mdash;possibly ... very
doubtfully, human&mdash;crawled in and out of the holes of the
universe.</p>
<p class="par">Again, in that unfathomable fashion, two worlds
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>convulsively changed places&mdash;and there was
no clear mark between the real and the unreal.</p>
<p class="par">Pushing at the mists did no good! One moment you were
<i>zero</i>; the next, you were <i>minus</i>.... The horror of it was
too much to bear!</p>
<p class="par">At last the pall of those dark, terrible outer places
lifted. The girl came fearfully back into consciousness, her being
shaken to its foundations by the terror of the thing it had passed
through. It had touched awful and unknown areas.</p>
<p class="par">Memories broke through indistinctly, fragmentarily. She
had suffered&mdash;been fearfully ill: Something had been agonizedly
sensible of that. How many beings were there in her to be aware? She
had known things before her complete awakening&mdash;but had not known
herself.</p>
<p class="par">It was not an unpopulated world into which she had
dropped: she knew now, somehow, that dim, fearful people were in
it&mdash;she had heard and felt them ... their passing through the air
... and even the silences that fell dreadfully down upon them.</p>
<p class="par">Over and over her dim, sickened wits repudiated her
mind&rsquo;s claim to this self ... denied that anything that was
<i>she</i> could find lodgment in this ragged figurement. The
personality offered for her acceptance was distorted out of the
slightest semblance of credibility. Some time her real self would come
back to her&mdash;all gathered together, and decently clad.</p>
<p class="par">Thirst obsessed her every faculty!</p>
<p class="par">She dragged herself up, and found that, though so weak
she could not hold one idea long, she was not too ill to move. She felt
that if she could get her mind wholly to come back and to grip hard,
her limbs would not shake so. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329"
href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She stared around her in astonishment, her mind
fluctuating uncertainly before what she looked out upon. Another
chimera! A toppling crazy world, patched together. She gave a mad
little scream. How could one live in a world in which there were so
many holes? One would be always falling out of them. What incredible
kind of senses must one have to exist in those moon-struck huts?</p>
<p class="par">She fled unsteadily out of the hovel where she had found
herself. Before what confronted her, her mouth opened again to cry out,
but closed gulpingly without a sound. That crooked coast, that retching
mouth of a bay, those blood-red nets!</p>
<p class="par">She pressed her hand across her head, as if to hold the
recollections that came flitting disjointedly through it, trying
fearfully but futilely to make coherent connections. A vision came
suddenly shocking before her&mdash;revolving, ribald human groups,
clawing and jeering about her, only to take flight.</p>
<p class="par">It was indeed in an outrageous form and surroundings
that she had found life. <i>They</i> had looted her dress, her shoes,
stockings&mdash;her hair, which her groping fingers had been so long
trying to find. Some one, in saturnine mercy, had flung a filthy rag
over her, which automatically she clutched about her. Having picked her
clean, it was inconceivable why they had let her live!</p>
<p class="par">Too stupefied to be afraid, she moved about in the
nightmare. Strange sounds came from the huts. She stopped and listened,
and commenced to tremble in fresh terror. She stumbled quickly away
across the sand.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly her foot struck a bundle of rags. She stopped
and gazed down. Something ghastly lay there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>in
the sand: a child struggling hideously with its last pinch of
strength&mdash;so futile an atom against the forces of the universe! As
she stooped closer and stared, horror swept over her in a chill of ice.
She knew now why there was no roar of moving here, no devil&rsquo;s
laughter; the place had been stricken with the plague&mdash;the
creatures were dying like rats in their trash-made huts.</p>
<p class="par">She wanted to run, but in her terror could not command
her muscles to move. The child&rsquo;s head, crusted with sores, lay
convulsed upon the sand. She regarded it in horror, repugnance, and
pity. Before her shaking vision rose a Pavilion&mdash;an Eastern
market-place, and from it a leper stretched forth a supplicating
hand.</p>
<p class="par">Pestilence-stricken hordes, unstaunched running sores!
Day by day she had passed the Pavilion, had shuddered at the
leper&rsquo;s bleached face turned, empty of hope, to the pitiless sun,
and had run away. In what dream had she seen those tortured
masks?&mdash;faces, praying for death&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Always before she had fled&mdash;there had come a moment
of violent contention with herself, when it had become inevitable that
she could not always go round, that sometime she must go
<i>through</i>, clear through. She had always run away&mdash;failed
completely: the cycle of those past failures seemed now to burn like
one of their sores within her. And now she was facing again this
crisis&mdash;her soul finally would no longer let her off. She closed
her eyes and put forth trembling fingers. The clutch of the leper
closed chilly around them. The circuit at last was complete.</p>
<p class="par">The moment her eyes opened, she uttered a piercing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>cry. Locked in her grasp lay the hand of the
plague-stricken child. The rigid fingers clutched around hers in a last
hold upon slipping life. Spasm after spasm of agony tore the puny
frame. A great throb of answering human pain shot through the
girl&rsquo;s heart. She sank down in the sand, deliriously clinging to
this scrap of life as if it were the last in the world. The child
shivered into stillness. Julie stared resentfully, indignantly about
her into hot space. Hopeless&mdash;hopeless! everywhere! She began to
cry weakly, dropping her head in the sand.</p>
<p class="par">Her thirst was overwhelming. She gathered herself up,
and crept cautiously among the huts. It was early afternoon, and the
denizens of the place were either absent, ill or dying. A few men were
fishing out on the bay. Nobody in this hole of death cared anything
about her. She moved on, peering stealthily through the apertures of
the huts. What she saw staggered her, but she went doggedly on till she
came upon some blackened water vessels. She knelt down to
drink&mdash;the water was afloat with skating insects&mdash;joyous,
horrible things, dancing on the water of dying men!</p>
<p class="par">She picked up one of the vessels, and went searching
till in one empty hut she found some matches and a pot of rice. With
her spoils she wandered down the sandy coast to the shelter of a great
rock, where, after much diffused effort, she contrived to make a fire
of driftwood.</p>
<p class="par">Drowsing upon the sand, she waited for her meal to cook.
The thought of leaving this ill-omened spot had already occurred to
her, but vaguely and accompanied by the presentiment of obstacles
facing her. First, she had no clothes; one could not walk out into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>city in an underskirt with a rag over
one&rsquo;s head. Then, she could not reason out where she was to go or
what she was to do, if she did go out. Last, hidden in the back of her
brain, and not yet presenting itself fully to light, was an insuperable
obstacle. Some unknown fettering chain was binding her&mdash;she knew
that she could not go.</p>
<p class="par">She drank thirstily of the hot boiled water, consumed a
part of the rice, and dropped asleep on the sand under the rock.</p>
<p class="par">Again came the torture of the same dream, the hard
wrenching out of drift land; it was morning when she awoke&mdash;dim
morning, before the sun. The first thing her eye lighted on was the
vessel of rice. She reached out and ate heartily of it. Then she rose,
and walked through the gray shadows of her monstrous world.</p>
<p class="par">Confronting her lay that sordid bit of doomed coast,
those crazy huddled huts shaken by the winds of devastation and hiding
the terror of death. Across her path a human body lay stark, like a
dead fish on the sand. The creature had died there in the night, and no
one had come to bury it. She was seized with the frantic impulse to get
out of this malevolent place as quickly as possible. She walked past
the huts, and heard again the moaning sounds. She stopped in despair.
Why had these people been abandoned to their destruction? Where was the
Board of Health? Nobody had come to help&mdash;nobody was coming.</p>
<p class="par">She leaned back against the wall, beyond which she had
meant to escape. She understood now how far beyond control the plague
had swept. She gazed back at the thing on the sand, at the livid face,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>empty mask that fixed with its hopeless stare.
Everywhere <i>somebody</i> was staying to see it out.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly the complete chain of her life&rsquo;s
circumstances came sweeping back into her consciousness. She remembered
why she was here&mdash;the stupendous, ineffectual effort she had made
to wrench herself free. And here she was back once more in the old
insoluble conditions, with nothing changed&mdash;up against the same
uncombatable odds, dumped here on this spot by a leveling,
inconjectural fate, lost among the lost! Her constant use of that
odious drug had insured her against the full fatality of the morphine
dose. She should have remembered that she would need far more than any
one else.</p>
<p class="par">It did not occur to her to try again. The horror of that
Outside Struggle still darkened her mind. There was no chance in the
world she would not take rather than risk again those unnameable
terrors. It had been made absolute that she must go on&mdash;even
though there was no hope: to struggle and still struggle, to the end.
She stood there against the wall, and tried to face once more the
relinquished battle.</p>
<p class="par">The moment when resolution came engulfed the world.</p>
<p class="par">Before it these creatures and their tragedy grew dim and
the Plague was wiped out. She shook away the tears that had fallen on
her face, and walked back to the huts.</p>
<p class="par">A glance through the holes that answered for windows
sufficed to reveal the extremity her life had touched. But before the
decision at the wall, she had already embraced the plague; before
reason had found the courage, an inner self had already stretched forth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>her hand. And thus began the sojourn in the
Pavilion&mdash;among dying men.</p>
<p class="par">In sheer surrender beyond belief the creatures gave up
to die. The girl did what she could: boiled water, cooked food, cared
for the sick, attempted to clean up the wretched community. The bodies
were buried along the shore, till Julie managed to get a frenzied
appeal through to the Board of Health.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, native servants of the Board came and took
charge of the bodies, assisted half-heartedly in cleaning out the dirt,
left medicines and food, and promised a doctor&mdash;who never
appeared. They stood themselves in deadly fear of the cholera, and knew
that in the general panic they would scarcely be held to account for
this wretched spot. They told Julie that the cholera suddenly, like
smoldering fire fanned to flames, had broken out from end to end of the
city. Always in cycles of time the Plague had come to sweep them to
destruction but never before as now. Terrible was the will of God over
his little men. The Americans were taking it too, they said. There were
not doctors enough to cope with the pest; certainly&mdash;when honest
men were stricken&mdash;none were to spare for this rogues&rsquo; nest.
The Americana who was so singularly situated&mdash;ought, they thought,
to be looking out for herself. It did not matter what happened to this
spawn of Beelzebub, to whom not even Mary in Heaven would stoop.</p>
<p class="par">Julie&rsquo;s mind burned with the fierce rage of
defeat&mdash;a pygmy battling along the sands of creation, she seemed
to herself. At times the cold horror of it seemed about to crush her; a
big, hideous game where, in ceaseless opposition, she moved, and the
Plague moved, and the Plague took the pieces&mdash;a low, one-sided
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>contest in which the pieces had never a chance.
They were trash, floatage on the current of life, but they were human.
They&mdash;who were in the possession of the miracle of
<i>thought</i>&mdash;to be swept away like straws by this filthy,
insentient thing! At times, she too dropped into their mood of apathy
and capitulation, but roused always to fight. She pressed into the
struggle her every faculty, conjured from passionate depths forces that
had never before seen light. Away back in Nahal, she had cast her soul
into the beginnings of this struggle, and it seemed as if the old
fervor had come to life and was being put to its crucial test.</p>
<p class="par">Along with the Plague, she fought the Hunger. The fire
of the old desire burned often in wild spurts. Sometimes she would pace
the sand, crying and clenching her hands, hour after hour. When the
delirium of the Hunger was at its worst, she would run madly out into
the surf and let the water break over her. There was nothing to lean
on, nothing to help!</p>
<p class="par">Then the Plague, with its monstrous fatality, would
sweep over her senses, and submerge her personal struggle. With so much
misery always before her eyes, she began to lose track of herself. The
Plague swallowed up everything; it came finally to stand as the real
antagonist of her existence, for it sought to rout the supreme stand
her spirit had taken. Deep in her consciousness she cherished a dream
of eventual conquest, of a time when inconceivably she should win. Just
to beat it back once! For so long it had snatched everything from under
her struggling hands. Of this she thought incessantly as she made her
rounds doggedly, combating each hopeless moment.</p>
<p class="par">But her creatures continued to die as under a doom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>of God. Julie felt as if she had come up against
the wall of the universe, where against its insensible strength her
human will was being shattered.</p>
<p class="par">Her charges, terribly broken, had accepted her as a
partner of their dark fate. They dug into their miserable stores, and
those of them who had still escaped the Plague went forth on errands of
industry or depredation, and returned to pour their spoils into the
common fund. What marvel of loyalty always brought them back to the
accursed spot, Julie could not fathom.</p>
<p class="par">At night she would steal out in the street, to claim her
own soul back for a moment. The streets were the universe. Even the
grotesqueries had a way of stumbling out toward the open, as if at the
last their wretched beings sought egress to freer spaces. She would
stand knitting her brows at the darkness, as if trying to claim some
solution out of it. Some time she meant to go away&mdash;but where? The
silent, empty streets troubled her. Up and down them the gay light of
the sun had poured upon brightly passing people; the perfume of baskets
of flowers being borne to market before the dew was off the day; the
cheery grind of ox-carts milling the golden dust of earth; the lilt of
the water-carrier&rsquo;s song; the rhythmic beat of the
washer-women&rsquo;s bats upon the stones; the flash of paddles, and
the swish of glad little boats making down the river to the
sea&mdash;all this had been part of the immortal stir of life that had
made this place for them a paradise of the sun.</p>
<p class="par">Terrible days these were! Sometimes peering out in the
daylight, she caught glimpses of the dejected funeral processions, the
bearers and mourners bowed down, as if the fate of man were too heavy
to be borne. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>The inconsequence of these lives made them more
than ever tragic: they were so humble; they never rebelled. Julie
thought that if God had been responsible for such things as these, man
would have rebelled against Him ages ago; but it was because man saw
his own ancestral mistakes made manifest that he bowed his head without
protest to their consequences.</p>
<p class="par">There had been heavy toll taken in the Tondo district.
In old newspapers that drifted into her retreat, Julie had read
familiar names; and, as the black hearses had dragged wearily by, she
knew that they carried many of her old pupils. As she watched them
pass, a vision would rise before her of big boys in cheap drill suits
and barefooted maidens pondering at the blackboards&mdash;poor
blundering things, eternally wistful over the courtesies and the
wisdoms of the West; Julie wept.</p>
<p class="par">Then she would remember that Chad had called her the
little lady goddess of the East. Standing in her ragged <i lang=
"es">camisa</i>, gazing from her walls across the streets, a desire
would sweep over her to go and reveal to Chad the heart of the East
that she had found far from his haunts.</p>
<p class="par">Where was Barry? The query arose a thousand times in her
mind. One of the papers had reported that he had left the city. Isabel,
too, she gleaned, had taken herself away. Julie recalled the visit
Isabel had made to some secret Island, and the paradise she had
conjured up.</p>
<p class="par">Her own disappearance, Julie saw, had apparently not
caused a ripple of concern. In this hour of stress, her absence from
her own world was not noted. Who, after all, was there to remark it?
From the Department, from the Se&ntilde;or, from Barry even, she had
cut <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>herself adrift. She had gone away from the
Reredos without explanation: but not even had they troubled themselves
to discover what had become of her.</p>
<p class="par">When the pain of her isolation struck too deep, she
would steal back behind the broken walls to the oblivion that
inevitably lay there. Here where the worms were being trodden out, one
was forced to forget one&rsquo;s own despair. Gradually she forgot
everything but the desire to find somewhere a power to conquer the
Plague. In its struggle, the girl&rsquo;s soul seemed to be reaching
out toward something which, though she could in no-wise define it,
began to appear accessible.</p>
<p class="par">One night, with the old sense of futility and wretched
helplessness, she was standing over the body of one of the poor
creatures who was taking too long to die. Through the tremendous
stretches of space above her great bolts of lightning intermittently
flashed. Power! Everywhere, great and invincible power. She wondered
passionately what a man must think or feel in his soul to touch the
source of it.</p>
<p class="par">The man&rsquo;s body before her commenced to take on its
final repose. His eyes lay open to the sky. Julie, bending over him
stared in sudden awe; for from under the dirt and grime of that
abandoned thug, a mystery was emerging. Suddenly the Veil pulled apart;
down there in the dust&mdash;the Common Soul! The Soul that was through
all things. She and the worm and God&mdash;in one unbreakable bond!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Supplies were becoming very hard to procure.
Indeed, Julie had for some time felt urged to go and seek assistance
from the outside world. Not the Plague alone, but starvation threatened
what was left of these people for whom she had been struggling. The
time had come when she must somehow face the outside world.</p>
<p class="par">But how without rational clothing could she undertake
such an errand? It was forced upon her that she must first of all
present herself to the Reredos, and get her clothes. She remembered
now, too, that she had left a little money in the pocket of a
dress,&mdash;not much, but it loomed tremendously to her eyes. It was
probably safe, since she had hidden the key to her trunk among the
<i lang="es">cadena de amor</i> trailing the window-sill, where no
<i lang="es">muchacho</i> would have dreamed of searching.</p>
<p class="par">Looking herself desperately over, in the darkness, with
full appreciation of her fantastic appearance, Julie found it an almost
insuperable business to thrust herself beyond the walls. Quite
impossible, on the other hand, was it to remain here longer. Gathering
her courage, and consoling herself with the thought that nobody in the
city longer remembered her, or was concerned about her, she set forth,
her head covered by an old scarf against the terrors of the
journey.</p>
<p class="par">She was not really too tall to pass for a native woman,
nor, in this light, too white to be taken for a mestiza,&mdash;and
Eurasians in native costume were not uncommon; but there was in her
movement a rhythm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340"
name="pb340">340</a>]</span>that would have revealed her at once as an
outsider to the curious observer. Fortunately, few such were abroad;
and by selecting a round-about way through unfrequented streets, she
contrived to pass unmarked through the dusk, though every nerve was
a-quiver when at last she crossed the bridge near the isolated estate
of the Reredos.</p>
<p class="par">Approaching the huge iron gates, she saw that in no part
of the house within her vision was a light to be seen. She knew that
there was in the rear wall a breach, which the children had enlarged,
by much chipping and hacking, to enable Chiquito&rsquo;s increasing
dimensions to pass through. This aperture would serve her particularly
well just now, since she could not bring herself to appear in this
fashion at the front door.</p>
<p class="par">She waded through the lush growth along the old stone
walls, wormed herself through Chiquito&rsquo;s egress, and hurried
across the grounds toward the house.</p>
<p class="par">The garden had commenced to take on the covertly wild
look of a thing that no longer acknowledges a master. All its lovely
blooms had, with the waywardness of tropical foliage, betaken
themselves to the tops of walls or trees. The snowy cadena shone
timidly in silvery filagree high against Julie&rsquo;s old window.</p>
<p class="par">The shell shutters were all closed fast; not a sound
came from behind them. The house was totally dark. Gaining courage, the
girl tried the door, knocked, and finally boldly shook the heavy
framework.</p>
<p class="par">Across the door sill and over the floor of the trellised
porch, sun-faded newspapers were broadly scattered. The Se&ntilde;or
had taken his family off to Spain, as he had said he would do. He had
doubtless gone hurriedly at the coming of the Plague to his district,
without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>stopping to give instructions concerning these
Manila periodicals, which the native carrier, with an increasingly
divergent aim, had continued to throw over the gate.</p>
<p class="par">Julie stooped and rummaged among the papers on the sill.
Stuck fast under the door, she discovered a couple of letters. She
pried them forth, and, examining them in the moonlight at the edge of
the porch, found they were both addressed to her. She moved toward the
seat under the fire-tree, which she and Barry had so often occupied;
the full moon was now flooding the garden; she could read her letters
there. In a vague appetite for news of the world she caught up, as she
went, two or three of the papers from the walk.</p>
<p class="par">Through curiosity she opened the unknown letter before
her uncle&rsquo;s. She wondered why little Mrs. Smith had taken it into
her head to write, after all this time.</p>
<p class="par">The Smiths were now stationed in Solano, and Mrs. Smith
rather pathetically wished to know if any of the things that had
happened to Julie&rsquo;s old friends of Nahal were happening to Julie.
She hoped not&mdash;for the worst thing that could happen to anybody
had happened to her. She knew that the natives over here suffered from
terrible things, but she had never dreamed that anything so awful could
befall her. Those first cruel red spots on her white skin&mdash;looking
as if they had been branded on with a red hot iron; Marlborough&rsquo;s
desperate efforts to disprove them; the doctor&rsquo;s reticence; the
nurse&rsquo;s gingerly cautious attitude, had all only disclosed the
unbearable truth. She had caught the small pox in Nahal&mdash;though
she was in Solano when it developed. Where else than in that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>ill-omened island could one have got such a
thing! She could demonstrate to everybody how fatal a spot to everybody
Nahal had been.</p>
<p class="par">She had not been anywhere near death, but rather than
this thing she would have prayed for any other conceivable, cruel curse
of the East&mdash;this East which had so many to give.</p>
<p class="par">Marlborough had been a miracle of devotion, assuring her
a thousand times that it would never matter to him what she looked
like. A girl might believe all this&mdash;but to a woman whose heart
was deeply versed in the frailty of men it was all intolerable. It
wasn&rsquo;t that she was marked so badly&mdash;not really so much at
all&mdash;but that she would never again see in the glass her old self.
Marlborough was going to take her to Paris and have her skin peeled,
but&mdash;she dared not believe.</p>
<p class="par">Yes, certainly, there must have been a curse on that
place! To further prove it there was Calmiden. After Julie left,
Calmiden had been ordered to Dao to take Adams&rsquo;s place.
&ldquo;But, you know, Julie, he was never Adams&rsquo;s metal, and I
guess he rebelled utterly at being put in Adams&rsquo;s shoes.
Templeton goaded Calmiden to what he did&mdash;one day he struck him. I
can&rsquo;t imagine any one&rsquo;s striking Calmiden and going on
living, can you? Well&mdash;Templeton didn&rsquo;t, Julie, and
that&rsquo;s it! It&rsquo;s so hard to tell, but in the big fight they
had&mdash;men lose their balance so completely in places like
this&mdash;Templeton somehow dropped dead. Of course you understand
that he was a rotten old shell of a dipsomaniac that would cave in at
the first few blows.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They brought Calmiden over here for trial, and
high-ranking officers came down from Manila. I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t know what took place, but they say
his men stood around him in an invincible and impenetrable wall of
evidence, and he was acquitted. But he will never be the same Kenneth
again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know, I think that somehow this place has
recoiled on us, Julie. We hated it and stood aloof from it. We despised
the people and made gods of ourselves. You remember I used always to
call them niggers&mdash;I thought I was showing the superiority of my
birthright that way; and not one throb of this life here ever touched
Calmiden&rsquo;s soul. Did any of us have any soul, particularly, in
it? Weren&rsquo;t we the dead wood on a mighty, struggling stream? I
don&rsquo;t know about you&mdash;what has happened to you; but I used
to think there was something different about you, for all your seeming
to take no real interest in anything here, save Calmiden&mdash;and
Adams, a little.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The regiment is soon to sail for home. Be sure to
look us up, as we come through.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Julie dropped the letter in her lap. She leaned forward
on her knee, and her mind went wandering over the stretches of the
past. So this was the message of Nahal&mdash;all there was ever to be;
of that Nahal which had caused her soul&rsquo;s difficulties. She
pondered deeply the whole immense problem. Had it been her individual
problem, set for her to solve&mdash;her fragment of eternal purposes to
prove? How utterly she had blundered and drifted along, evading the
particular, crucial nonconforming bit of the universe that she had
perhaps come into life to subdue. Even when aware of her flaming
objective, she had dallied weakly and wastefully in easy and uninspired
areas of life. Stupidly she had let her fire die out, and her being go
to waste. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Once she had been offered the choice of her ideals or
Calmiden, and she had chosen Calmiden, though he was the antagonist of
all her stirring beliefs. For a passing whim of passion, she had flung
her sublimest convictions to the winds. That there were punishments for
such perfidies of spirit she had come tragically to comprehend. She had
halted and turned, given up&mdash;letting the things she had made a
Covenant with go back to fate unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="par">None of these men she had known <i>here</i> would have
turned back, at any cost; as agents of the future, of the whole
onmoving universe, nothing had counted with them&mdash;not happiness,
nor life, nor love; while <i>she</i> had demanded insistently and
supremely her human happiness, and, failing to obtain it, had let go,
like the rest of the derelicts of life: and there the East had stepped
in to capture her, as inevitably it captured all of her mood.</p>
<p class="par">With here and there little flashes of eternal verities
overwhelming her, she sat and thought more profoundly than ever she had
thought in her life. She wanted to probe to the bottom and release the
last vestige of the illusion of the past. Those few words of Mrs. Smith
stood out like flame against her brain: &ldquo;This place has recoiled
on us&mdash;because we hated it, and stood aloof.&rdquo; Julie felt
this sink into some deep, almost inaccessible place, and come forth
again.</p>
<p class="par">That was the key to the long mystery. That was the key
to <i>her</i>. She remembered how contemptuous her friends in Nahal had
all been of the work in hand, how anxious they had been to be rid of
it&mdash;except her. She covered her face with her hands: <i>all but
her!</i> She had clung to Nahal as a glory for herself&mdash;as a
universe for a small and exhilarantly inflated ego to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>expand in. Her sincere energies had borne fruit,
but too often she had brushed aside all that had not colored her
adventurous fancy. Turned in upon herself, she had skimmed fruitlessly
this brown well of being. A psychological Alexander taking by assault
the soul of Asia. In what a halo of Eastern colors she had planned to
do that! She had chosen the East as a stage for her personal grandeur.
She had expected a superlative destiny somehow to be handed out from
it.</p>
<p class="par">But from the East&rsquo;s dark face and blunted mind she
had actually always shrunk; and as that foolish little woman, in a
moment of tremendous wisdom, had pointed out, the East had recoiled
upon her and pulled her down with ruthless irony to its lowest levels.
Mrs. Smith might as well have said the universe, which demands atom for
atom of energy, ounce for ounce of force.</p>
<p class="par">Then had come the inscrutable forces, which had taken up
her life and threshed it mercilessly to the point of death, and
winnowed it out. The Great Law had taken her in hand, broken her old
self to bits, and of the pieces transmuted a form to its ends. In order
to come truly into life, she had first to be destroyed! She felt a
thrill of the old exhilaration to have at last found the way.</p>
<p class="par">She opened her uncle&rsquo;s letter, the moon falling in
soft sheets about her.</p>
<p class="par">It was upon that letter that for a moment the new fate
seemed to hinge. He had written to say that his affairs were in better
shape; that he had, in fact, sold the factories, advantageously; that
some money of Julie&rsquo;s, which he had long ago invested for her,
would now be available for her. He urged her to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>come
home; he was perfectly sure that the East was no place for a girl
alone. She need not live with Mrs. Dreschell, if she did not choose to,
but with more congenial relatives.</p>
<p class="par">The girl sank once more into thought. She sat a long
time staring at the moon-lit night, at the fire-flowers dropping
through it like soft sparks. Over her came at last the conviction that
she would never leave&mdash;that the gates of the East had indeed
closed after her for good. There would be no more turning. She was
going straight on, only struggle, everlasting struggle lying ahead.
Things were moving toward something over here, and rather than all the
safe paths of the world she would choose this vivid, perilous
existence. That was what the levels had done for her&mdash;taken out
all fear. She remembered Barry&rsquo;s high peak, where from him also
fear had dropped. Here the Hunger had been vanquished. Back in that
forlorn spot, she had fought the Plague, and lost; but the Plague had
fought the Hunger, and won. There were big forces over here, to fight
with or against. Everything for her must be created new. In the silence
of the night, she recalled a vision of waiting and watching that she
had seen in this same garden. Yes, she would go farther on.</p>
<p class="par">She reached down for the papers, which had slipped to
her feet. She wanted to see if that stroke of fate&mdash;Independence,
had come. The most recent of the papers was two days old, and conveyed
the information that the bill had failed to pass the Congress of the
United States.</p>
<p class="par">There would be no Philippine Republic! The significance
of this stupendous fact did not penetrate her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>all
at once. Oddly scattered, different thoughts filtered through her
mind.</p>
<p class="par">Fate had decided aright. It would take these people
awhile longer to make ready to meet the future. And if Isabel were
right in her prophecies of the coming clash of the world, they would
certainly be best as they were&mdash;till the earth were made safe for
such little peoples as they.</p>
<p class="par">Isabel&rsquo;s dreams then were fallen&mdash;and
Barry&rsquo;s hopes were realized. Slowly the full realization of the
turn of events broke upon her consciousness. The aims and hopes of
Barry and Isabel could never have been united&mdash;never in any case.
She saw that now.</p>
<p class="par">Where then was Barry? The question flashed through every
atom of her.</p>
<p class="par">Her eyes, which unconsciously had wandered down the
columns of the paper at which she was staring, rested on Barry&rsquo;s
name&mdash;and the monstrous, incredible thing printed with it!</p>
<p class="par">A process of deadly ossification, starting with her feet
and traveling to her brain, seemed to be rooting her to this spot
forever.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; she murmured in
stupid agony to the night.</p>
<p class="par">The last blow out of the East! The uncombatable enemy!
She flung out her arms despairingly, and crumpled crushed on the
seat.</p>
<p class="par">Silent as was the garden, it had a myriad of
conveyances. They urged her to her feet, and on. She ran to the wall,
thrust herself through the crevice, and continued to run along the
dusky street till she came upon a <i lang="es">carromata</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Now the <i lang="es">carromata</i>, by all the chances
of the East, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>was driven by the Pedro who had looted her body
and who believed it at this moment to be buried in the sea. Therefore
when he saw Julie, from whose hacked blond hair the wrap had slipped,
Pedro, who had become too familiar with her features to forget them,
gave a cry, and tried frantically to pass on. But Julie had Disgusto by
the bit, and could not be dislodged.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Drive me to Calle Arzobispo at once!&rdquo; she
commanded.</p>
<p class="par">Pedro whimpering and shivering, sure now that the ghost
of the unfortunate Se&ntilde;orita had come back to haunt his <i lang=
"es">carromata</i> forever, gave up resistance; and, when Julie had
taken her seat, obeyed her frenzied injunctions with a rattle of terror
in his throat. He drove at terrific speed, till Disgusto appeared ready
to drop.</p>
<p class="par">It would be this way, always, Pedro knew. This ghost
whom he had plundered in life would not only take complete possession
of his <i lang="es">carromata</i>, but would drive to death all the
horses he could buy. So, when upon nearing the vicinity of the
cathedral, the ghost commanded him to stop, leaped over the wheel, and
shot forward without paying the fare, Pedro, instead of summoning a
policeman, hurled terrific blows upon Disgusto and fled for all he was
worth.</p>
<p class="par">In the sacerdotal section of Arzobispo, with the
monastic walls rearing darkly around her and the shadowy trees looming
above her like super-human shapes, Julie paused. There was his house,
lifting out of the dark foliage. She went forward unsteadily. At every
step the world seemed to crumble under her tread, and death to claim
all that was left of her universe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A native policeman emerged from the shadows as she crept
up to the gate. He surveyed her wonderingly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I must go in there!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Women, women!&rdquo; he exclaimed fussily.
&ldquo;The master of that house will never think of women any more.
There was another one here this evening, crying as if this old earth
were a cage and she were shut in it. She was a beautiful lady, too,
with great blue eyes; but not a soul in that house, I tell you, stirred
out to her. So at last she went groping away in the blackness. You had
better go too. I am guarding the gate so that he shall die in peace.
Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there is no one to let you in. The
servants ran away, being afraid of the Plague&mdash;all but one boy. A
young boy, a good boy; he is a Visayan, as so am I. They will stand by
when Tagalogs take to their heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A vivid intuition flashed through the girl&rsquo;s soul.
Stepping past the wordy policeman, she pressed her face close against
the bars of the gate. &ldquo;Delphine!&rdquo; she called, again and
again through the night.</p>
<p class="par">A window slid open above. She could distinguish a slight
figure standing in the aperture.</p>
<p class="par">Tremulously she called again: &ldquo;Delphine! It is
I&mdash;your <i lang="es">maestra</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boy&rsquo;s wondering treble answered her:
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Maestra!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tears of triumph rolled down her face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come quickly, and open the gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was coming. She listened for every fall of his
hurrying slippers.</p>
<p class="par">At last a white <i lang="es">camisa</i> came fluttering
through the darkness, the brave white <i lang="es">camisa</i> of the
poor little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>brown knight who had set out so long ago for the
grand adventure.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Maestra</i>, my <i lang=
"es">Maestra</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed softly and incredulously, staring
at her through the bars of the gate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! You stayed with him!&rdquo; was all she could
say, the tears choking her.</p>
<p class="par">The boy opened the gate, and let Julie up into the
ominous stillness of the house. At the top of the staircase, he uttered
a soft word, and Doctor Braithwaite appeared, a tall gray wraith spent
with much struggle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My <i lang="es">maestra</i> has come back.&rdquo;
Delphine quivered with simple pride.</p>
<p class="par">The Doctor stared hard for several moments, while Julie
made an agitated effort to explain. At last he contrived to recover
himself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Chad was right, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
believed that Isabel had tried to do away with you. After you had gone,
she endeavored to make it appear that you had gone to meet a man in the
southern islands. If I hadn&rsquo;t been over here so long&mdash;I
think I might find you surprising.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry was taken ill in the provinces,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;Your boy brought him back, and has stuck to him to the
end. If you have never done anything else here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He stopped short, his face contracted painfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She was pitiful enough anyway, this thin, spent little
creature, in her outlandish garments, and he winced at the effect of
the blow he had delivered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I must see him,&rdquo; she said, in a low
voice.</p>
<p class="par">He shook his head. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s
impossible&mdash;with the Plague.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She gave a sobbing little laugh. &ldquo;The Plague! Why
that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been&mdash;with it all the time.
I&mdash;&rdquo; her head dropped&mdash;&ldquo;watched them
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His gray lips twitched. &ldquo;Yes, we watch them die.
Every doctor and every nurse on double duty. Chad and I took care of
Barry. Then Rosalie took it, and Chad had to go to her. She&rsquo;s
gone already.&rdquo; He paused.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Barry&rsquo;s case has been different. Usually
they go out like lightning&mdash;but he wouldn&rsquo;t die! And he
wouldn&rsquo;t go to San Lazarus. He kept saying he was going to get
over it quick. Said he had to be alive in these times. I never saw a
man fight so hard; he has fought with the last artery and capillary.
Doctor though I am, I really believed that he would win over sheer
matter. And I wanted to see him triumph&mdash;it would have seemed like
a victory for the race.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>He</i> believed you would come back.&rdquo;
The Doctor looked at her hard for several moments of deep silence, then
he said: &ldquo;The East has made you strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He sank heavily into a chair. &ldquo;If you wish, you
may watch. It is good that you have come. I believe I could not have
kept my eyes open to-night&mdash;even for him! No sleep for
nights&mdash;and nights!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s unconscious now&mdash;nothing more to
do. Watch a while&mdash;and call me&mdash;&rdquo; Even as he spoke, the
Doctor sank sleeping in his chair.</p>
<p class="par">She turned down the hall, groping ahead of her as
through gulfs of darkness, her last plank shaking beneath her,
scorching agony tearing at her heart.</p>
<p class="par">His door stood open. There was a very dim light in the
room. From the threshold, she could see the rumpled head, the quenched
conquered face. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352"
name="pb352">352</a>]</span>stumbled to the bed; and, dropping down
beside it, flung her arms about him, as if to hold off with main
desperate human strength that last blow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d come back&mdash;wherever you
were&mdash;if I called you!&rdquo; she cried in anguished despair.</p>
<p class="par">She lifted her head, and looked about her in wild
entreaty. Where was He&mdash;in nights like these&mdash;who had walked
human paths of despair? Somewhere here He must still be fighting the
battle of death!</p>
<p class="par">She crouched down on the floor; the spectacle of that
inert form was insupportable. Suddenly she lifted her head. From out
the soft wonder of darkness, with its swinging worlds, Barry was coming
toward her&mdash;all alight, as of old&mdash;looking as he always
looked when he had something perfectly new to do. Then he passed on,
and darkness dropped once more.</p>
<p class="par">With all the appeal in her, she flung her spirit out
upon the night. Power, power&mdash;everywhere out
there&mdash;tremendous; terrifying power behind the illimitable
stretches of space, behind the swinging worlds, veining the universe
like lightning to eternal depths. If only she could force a foothold in
its great conspiracy! She had traveled far, gone deep to find it, and
had more than once felt it graze her being. Just around the corner,
close it was&mdash;yet out of touch. All that was in her soul, or would
ever be, stretched after it in this moment. She tore at her
circumscribed human vision as at some fatally binding bandage across
her eyes. Just to see clear once!</p>
<p class="par">Her consciousness in its search swept out of its
surroundings, beyond the barriers of flesh. The stillness of the night
seemed charged with the light and force of swift traveling stars.
Struggling with the legions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>of darkness and death, she
stumbled suddenly into the kingdoms of the unseen.</p>
<p class="par">The Doctor bent, in the gray light, over the bed. Nobody
had called him; and, exhausted, he had slept throughout the night. He
had come hurriedly, and stooped down to investigate the outstretched
form.</p>
<p class="par">He picked up one of the hands, and counted the pulse
intently. A change passed over his face. He placed his ear to the
heart. Then he slowly straightened up, and stood staring before him, in
a trance of thought.</p>
<p class="par">The dawn came peeping into the room. He bent over, and
studied once more, without drawing breath, his patient&rsquo;s
appearance in its reflection. A stir near at hand caused him to turn
sharply. He had forgotten the girl.</p>
<p class="par">He concentrated upon her a puzzled look.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly, as if
groping through dazed layers of thought, &ldquo;that you had better get
up. He has pulled back!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She started, then slowly raised herself from the floor.
For a moment, she appeared to be stretching herself out of sleep; then
he had an utterly odd sensation that she was putting out her hands in
the red dawn toward some invisible thing.</p>
